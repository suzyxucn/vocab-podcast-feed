  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is 'disparate'. This is an adjective that describes things that are fundamentally different from each other in kind or quality. In the world of Product Management, you might use 'disparate' to describe various aspects of your work, such as data, user feedback, or even team members' skills.

Let?s put 'disparate' into action. Imagine you're in a product meeting, discussing user feedback. You might say, 'We are receiving disparate feedback from our users. Some are praising the app?s simplicity, while others are asking for more complex features.' Here, 'disparate' describes the fundamentally different feedback you're receiving. 

Or, consider this: during a team update meeting, you might say, 'Our team is made up of people with disparate skills, from software development to graphic design. This diversity is our strength.' In this case, 'disparate' is used to highlight the variety of skills within your team. 

It's important to note that 'disparate' is equally appropriate in both spoken and written communication situations in business English. 

There are also some great alternatives to 'disparate'. 'Diverse' is a fantastic choice, especially when talking about variety within a group or range. 'Varying' can also be used in a similar context, but it often implies a range or spectrum of differences. These words are also suitable for both spoken and written contexts.

So, remember, when you want to emphasize fundamental differences or variety, 'disparate', 'diverse', or 'varying' can be your go-to words. This can help you convey your thoughts with clarity and precision, whether in meetings, emails, or reports. That's it for today's word. Tune in next time for more vocabulary to power up your product management communication. Until then, keep practicing and using 'disparate' confidently in your business English conversations. Bye for now!"</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "compatible". 

In the realm of product management and business, "compatible" is a versatile term that refers to the ability of different systems, processes, or components to work together effectively without conflict. It's a word that reflects synergy and cohesion, creating a sense of unity and functionality in a business context.

Imagine you're in a product planning meeting, discussing the integration of a new feature into your existing product. You might say, "We need to ensure that this new feature is compatible with our current app architecture". In this context, "compatible" conveys the need for the new feature to smoothly function within the existing app framework.

Or let's say you're giving a team update on a new collaboration with another department. You could express, "Our work styles are highly compatible, leading to a productive and successful partnership". Here "compatible" is used to describe the harmonious blending of work styles between different teams.

So, "compatible" is a word that can be used in both written and oral communication. It's a term that is frequently used in emails, reports, presentations, and casual conversations in the workplace.

Now, let's explore some alternative words. "Congruent" is a term that carries a similar sense but is more commonly used in formal written contexts. It implies more than just compatibility; it suggests a perfect match. Another synonym is "harmonious", which carries a slightly softer tone, often used in spoken communication to describe relationships or elements that work well together. Lastly, "cooperative" can be used to describe systems, processes, or teams that work well together, typically used in both spoken and written English but with a more casual tone.

In summary, "compatible" and its alternatives - "congruent", "harmonious", and "cooperative", are all about the ability to work together seamlessly. They are essential words in the product management vocabulary, reflecting the continuous strive for unity and functionality in all aspects of business operations.

Thank you for joining Nexus PM with Suzy. Keep practicing these words, and soon you'll be confidently navigating the world of product management in English. Until next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <title>Word 5 - Shepherd</title>
  <enclosure url="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=18rcAFIqnCZkk-BXty7FE9TpMZA-b_23i" length="123456" type="audio/mpeg" />

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "shepherd". Now, you might be thinking of the traditional meaning of shepherd ? someone who guides and looks after a flock of sheep, but in a product or business context, it's not that different. When we're discussing product management, to shepherd means to guide a project, a product, or a feature from its initial stages through to its completion. It's about being the leader who ensures everything moves smoothly along its path to its destination.

For instance, imagine you're in a product meeting. Your team just came up with a brilliant idea for a new feature. As the product manager, you would then 'shepherd' this feature ? guiding it through the development process, making sure it stays on track and aligns with the overall vision. 

Or, in a team update situation, you might hear someone say, "We need a strong leader to shepherd this project to its successful launch." This means they need someone to navigate the project through all its stages, ensuring all the pieces fit together seamlessly and all challenges are addressed promptly.

So, to shepherd is to guide, to lead, to manage. It's a term used commonly in both spoken and written settings. A few synonyms or similar words are "steer," "guide," and "direct." The nuances are subtle. When you 'steer' a project, it implies a gentle guidance, like steering a boat downstream. To 'direct' is a bit stronger, suggesting more control or authority. And to 'guide' is somewhere in-between, implying a supportive role in leading the way. All these alternatives are also used in both spoken and written communication in the business world. 

Remember, as the shepherd of a project or product, you're not just a participant, but the guide who ensures that everything stays on track to reach its destination successfully. You're the one who keeps the team aligned, the project on course, and the vision intact. That's your role as the shepherd in the world of product management. 

Thanks for joining me today on Nexus PM. Keep leading, keep shepherding, and I'll catch you in the next episode!</podcast:transcript>

  <title>Word 6 - Chart The Path</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "chart the path". Now, when we think of a chart, we might think of graphs or diagrams, but in the context of product management or business, to "chart the path" means to outline the strategic direction, or to create a plan for achieving a particular goal. It?s like drawing a map to your destination, but the journey is your project, and the destination is your objective.

Let?s imagine a product meeting where you have to introduce a new feature. You might say, ?In order to launch our new feature successfully, we need to chart the path carefully. This includes defining our target market, outlining the development process, and establishing key milestones along the way.?

Or maybe you?re giving a team update: "We've made great progress this quarter, and now we need to chart the path for the next one. That means setting clear goals, defining our KPIs, and aligning our resources effectively."

"Chart the path" is commonly used in both written and spoken settings. It?s a clear, concise way to convey the idea of strategic planning. 

Now, if you want to mix things up, you could use alternative phrases like "forge a path", "carve out a route", or "set the course". These phrases essentially mean the same thing, but "forge a path" has a more dynamic, active feel, like you're breaking new ground. "Carve out a route" suggests that the path is not yet clear, and needs to be created or discovered. "Set the course" is more typically used in a strategic or leadership context. All of these phrases can be used in both written and spoken settings.

Remember, when you chart the path, you're not just making a plan. You're creating a strategic journey towards success, and that?s a powerful concept in the world of product management. So next time you're in a meeting or writing a report, don't be afraid to chart your path. It's a clear, concise way to say, "Here's our plan, and this is how we're going to get there." 

Thank you for joining me on Nexus PM. Keep charting those paths to success, and I'll see you next time.</podcast:transcript>

  <title>Word 7 - Ring A Bell</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "ring a bell". Now, don't get confused, we're not literally talking about ringing a bell! In the business world, when something 'rings a bell', it means it sounds familiar or reminds you of something. 

Imagine you're in a product meeting, discussing a new feature. If your colleague says, "This idea seems to ring a bell, didn't we discuss something similar last quarter?" they're expressing that they recall a discussion related to the current idea. Or perhaps, during a team update, you might say, "The name of that client rings a bell. Did I meet them at the last networking event?" Here, you are indicating that the client?s name sounds familiar.

This phrase is typically used in spoken English, but it can also be found in written communications. It's a handy idiom to express familiarity in a casual yet professional manner. 

There are a few alternative phrases you can use in a similar context. "Sounds familiar" is one. For example, "That strategy sounds familiar, have we tried it before?" This can be used in both spoken and written English and is commonly found in professional conversations.

Another alternative is "jog my memory". You might say, "That report title jogs my memory, I think I've read it before." This phrase is a bit more formal and is more common in written English, particularly in emails.

In summary, when something 'rings a bell', it stirs up a memory or seems familiar. It's a useful phrase to express that something isn't entirely new to you, whether you're in a product meeting, planning a feature, or catching up with your team. Whether it's 'ring a bell', 'sounds familiar', or 'jog my memory', these phrases add a touch of informality and authenticity to your business communication. 

Remember, language is not just about words, but how we use them to connect and engage. So, don't be afraid to use these phrases in your next meeting or email. Until next time, keep communicating confidently!"</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "cadence". Cadence is a term that we often use in the product and business world to describe the rhythm or pattern of how something is done over time. It's about the regularity of your actions and processes.

Imagine it as the heartbeat of your project or team. Just as our heart maintains a steady beat, a product team needs to maintain a steady cadence of meetings, updates, and deliveries. For example, a Product Manager might say, "We have a weekly cadence for our team updates every Monday morning, and a monthly cadence for our feature planning meetings."

Words like "rhythm", "pace", and "cycle" can be used as alternatives to cadence, but they might convey slightly different nuances. "Rhythm" suggests a more natural, less structured process, while "pace" focuses more on speed rather than regularity. "Cycle" implies a series of events that repeat in the same order. 

"Cadence" is used in both spoken and written English. You might hear it during meetings or see it in an email. Similarly, "rhythm", "pace", and "cycle" can be heard in conversations or read in business documents. 

Just remember, using the right cadence in your work can help ensure that everyone knows what to expect and when to expect it. It brings predictability and stability, which are key to managing any successful product. Whether it's a daily stand-up, a bi-weekly sprint, or a quarterly review, setting the right cadence can keep your team harmonious and productive.

And that's it for today's word, "cadence". Remember, it's all about the rhythm of your activities. Now, go and make your own cadence in the world of product management!

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "perception". In the realm of product management and business, the term "perception" refers to how your product or service is viewed or understood by customers, stakeholders, or even your team members.

Let's imagine you're in a product planning meeting. You may say, "Based on our market research, the customer's perception of our product is positive, but we still need to improve our user interface to enhance this perception further." Here, you're discussing how customers view your product, and what you can do to influence this perception.

Or maybe you're in a team update meeting, and you say, "There seems to be a perception that our project is behind schedule. We need to communicate more effectively about our progress to change this perception." Here, you're tackling an internal perception and proposing a solution to alter it.

So, perception is about understanding, interpretation, and viewpoint, and it's a term used extensively in both spoken and written settings.

Instead of "perception," you could use "view," "impression," or "understanding." These alternatives are also versatile, but with slight nuances. "View" is somewhat more casual and is commonly used in spoken English, whereas "impression" is a bit more formal and is often seen in written contexts. "Understanding" is neutral and works well in both spoken and written English.

Remember, your aim as a product manager is not just to manage products, but also perceptions. You work to shape the way your product is understood and valued by others. So, "perception" is a key term in your vocabulary toolbox. Keep it handy and use it confidently in your interactions!

That's all for today's episode. Stay tuned for more vocabulary insights on Nexus PM with Suzy. Happy managing!</podcast:transcript>

  <title>Word 10 - Shed Light On</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "shed light on". When we say "shed light on" in a product or business context, we are essentially referring to the action of making something clear or easier to understand. Think of it as illuminating a dark room, where the thing you?re trying to understand is in the shadows. When you "shed light on" it, the obscurities dissipate, and understanding emerges. 

Let's take an example. Imagine you?re in a product meeting, and there?s a sudden dip in user engagement. You've been tasked to 'shed light on' the situation. This means you need to investigate and clarify why users are not engaging as much. You'd likely examine data, seek feedback, and then present your findings to the team, thereby 'shedding light on' the issue.

Another example could be during feature planning. If there's confusion about how a proposed feature would benefit the product, a team member could 'shed light on' its potential by giving a clear explanation or demonstration. 

So, to 'shed light on' something is to clarify, explain or demystify it. This phrase is used both in written and spoken communication - it's as helpful in emails as it is in in-person discussions.

Alternative expressions you could use include "clarify", "elucidate", or "explicate". These words share similar meanings, but with nuances. 'Clarify' is more general, while 'elucidate' and 'explicate' are more formal, often used in academic or technical contexts. Just like "shed light on", these alternatives are suitable for both written and spoken communication.

That's it for today's word. Remember, when you 'shed light on' something, you make it clear, you illuminate it. And don't be afraid to use it or its alternatives in your professional conversations or written correspondences. It's a great way to demonstrate your understanding or help others understand better. Until next time, this is Suzy from Nexus PM, helping you navigate the world of English communication in business. Happy learning!"</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "with regard for". This phrase is a vital tool in our English communication arsenal, especially in the product management sphere.

In a business or product context, "with regard for" means considering something or keeping something in mind. It's used when you're taking into account a specific factor or aspect while making decisions, planning strategies, or communicating with your team. This phrase is commonly used in both written and spoken settings, making it versatile for various scenarios.

Let's bring this to life with a couple of examples. Imagine you're in a product planning meeting and you need to consider user feedback while developing new features. You would say, "In developing this new feature, we need to act with regard for user feedback." This means you're not just thinking about the technical aspects, but you're also considering what users have told you about their needs and desires.

Or let's say you?re giving a team update on a new product?s environmental impact. You might say, ?With regard for our commitment to sustainability, we've ensured the new product?s packaging is 100% recyclable."

Now, let's explore some alternatives to "with regard for", each with slightly different nuances. "Considering" is an excellent alternative. It is also used in both written and spoken settings. For instance, "Considering our budget constraints, we need to prioritize these features."

Another alternative is "bearing in mind", usually more conversational and often found in spoken English. It gives a sense of caution or awareness about a certain factor. For instance, "Bearing in mind the tight deadline, we need to streamline our processes."

Finally, "taking into account" is a more formal phrase, frequently used in writing. It implies a thorough analysis or consideration of all factors. For example, "Taking into account all feedback, we must revise our product strategy."

In conclusion, "with regard for" and its alternatives help you express consideration and thoughtfulness in your professional communications. They underline the fact that you're not making decisions or planning in a vacuum, but are attentive to different aspects and viewpoints. 

That's it for today's episode of Nexus PM. Remember, whether it's user feedback, budget constraints, or sustainability concerns, always communicate with regard for all factors. Happy communicating!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "attribute to". This phrase is commonly used in the business world and it simply means to regard something as being caused by or resulting from something else. 

Let's dive into an example: Imagine you're a product manager working on a new feature for your app. The user engagement has increased recently and you believe it's because of this new feature. In a team meeting, you might say, "The recent spike in user engagement can be attributed to the implementation of our new feature." Here, "attribute to" is used to show the cause and effect relationship between the new feature and the increased user engagement.

Or perhaps, in a product planning meeting, you might say, "The success of our competitor's product can be largely attributed to their unique marketing approach." Here, you're stating that the competitor's marketing approach is a significant factor in their product's success. 

Our phrase, "attribute to," is versatile, used in both spoken and written contexts. It's a great tool to confidently express your analysis or observations.

Now, let's touch on some alternatives to "attribute to". A similar phrase you could use is "ascribe to" which has a very similar meaning, although it is a bit more formal and often seen in written reports. Another alternative is "credit to". If you?re talking about a positive outcome, this phrase is a perfect fit. It's widely used in both spoken and written settings.

Like "attribute to", these alternatives help you express cause and effect relationships. They're your go-to phrases when you need to pinpoint what's causing a particular outcome. 

So there you have it. "Attribute to" is a phrase that helps you confidently analyze and express cause and effect in your product management role. It's a phrase that communicates your understanding of the factors affecting your product's success. Remember, you can also use "ascribe to" or "credit to" as alternatives.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: 'subject to'. This term is frequently used in the context of business and product management, indicating that something is dependent or conditional upon something else. It?s a bridge that connects two related ideas or conditions.

Imagine you're in a product meeting. You might hear, 'The product launch is subject to the completion of user testing.' This means the product launch depends on whether the user testing is completed or not. 

Or consider you're in a feature planning session. Someone might say, 'The feature development is subject to the approval of the stakeholders.' Here again, the development of a feature is conditional upon the approval from stakeholders.

'Subject to' is a phrase that is equally at home in both written and spoken settings. It's clear, concise, and universally understood in the world of product management.

However, we do have alternative phrases. One is 'contingent upon'. This term also shows a condition or dependence. For example, 'The product release is contingent upon the outcome of the beta testing.' But be aware, 'contingent upon' is more formal and is usually seen in written documents rather than everyday conversation.

Another alternative is 'depending on'. As in, 'Depending on the market research, we may need to pivot our strategy.' This phrase is more casual and is often used in both spoken and written settings.

So, to recap: 'subject to' is a handy phrase that expresses something is dependent or conditional upon something else. It's versatile, adaptable, and widely used in both spoken and written English. 

Remember, the key to mastering any new term is practice. Try using 'subject to', 'contingent upon', or 'depending on' in your next product meeting or email. You'll sound more confident and natural in no time.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "defer". Now, in a business or product management context, to "defer" means to postpone or delay a decision or action. When we defer something, we're not saying no, we're saying "not now". It's a strategy often used in product management when dealing with multiple tasks or when prioritizing features.

Let's imagine a scenario. You're in a product review meeting and your team proposes a new feature. However, you're aware that current resources need to be focused on more urgent updates. So, you might say, "This is a great idea, but we need to defer it to the next quarter." Here, "defer" helps you navigate the situation without completely disregarding the proposal. 

Another example could be during a team update. Maybe a team member suggests a change, but you think it needs more discussion. You could say, "Let's defer this topic to our next meeting when we have more time to delve into it."

That's "defer" for you - a handy tool to manage your workflow in a way that respects everyone's input. It's used equally in both spoken and written settings, from meetings to emails.

Now, some alternative words to "defer" are "postpone" and "delay". Both are used in similar contexts but with slight nuances. "Postpone" is often used when there's a specific plan to revisit the matter, while "delay" might suggest there are hindrances slowing down the process. Like "defer", these words are versatile and can be used in both spoken and written communication.

So next time you need to manage your product timelines or handle team suggestions, remember "defer", "postpone", or "delay". They're your linguistic allies in maintaining a smooth product management journey. So, don't hesitate to use them when you need to buy some time or allocate resources wisely.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "exposed to". In the world of product management, being "exposed to" something means that you have been introduced to or have experience in a particular area. It's a phrase that's often used to describe someone's familiarity with a particular skill, topic, or process.

Imagine you're a product manager in a team meeting. You might say, "I have been exposed to Agile project management methods in my previous role, so I am familiar with the process." This means you have hands-on experience with Agile methodologies and can comfortably apply them in your current role.

Or consider a scenario where you are discussing a new feature planning with your team. You might say, "Our developers should be exposed to the client's feedback to understand their needs better." In this case, you're advocating for your developers to have direct interaction with the client's feedback to gain more profound insights into what the client wants.

The phrase "exposed to" is commonly used in both written and spoken settings. It's a versatile phrase that adds a touch of professionalism to your communication. 

Now, if you're looking for alternatives, "familiar with" and "experienced in" are great options. "Familiar with" is slightly less formal than "exposed to", and is often used in more casual, spoken contexts. On the other hand, "experienced in" carries a similar weight to "exposed to" and can be used in both written and spoken forms. However, "experienced in" usually implies a deeper level of knowledge or skill.

Remember, in the realm of product management, being "exposed to" various experiences not only enriches your skillset but also makes you a more versatile professional. 

That's it for today's episode on Nexus PM with Suzy. Stay tuned for more words that matter in your product management journey. Until next time, keep learning and keep growing!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. In today's episode, we're diving into the use of a handy phrase often heard in the product management realm: "opt for". 

In a business or product context, to "opt for" something means to choose it, especially over other alternatives. It's about making a decision based on your assessment or preference. 

Let's set a scene. Imagine you're in a product meeting where you're discussing the next feature to add to your software. You might say, "Given the limited resources and the urgency of our customer needs, we've decided to opt for the chatbot feature instead of the voice recognition one." Here, "opt for" communicates that a conscious choice has been made favouring one feature over another.

Or consider a team update, where you might say, "After reviewing user feedback, we're opting for a more intuitive design for our homepage." Again, "opt for" shows a decisive choice based on considered factors. 

"Opt for" is versatile and can be used in both written and spoken settings. It's a staple in emails, reports, meetings, or even casual conversations. 

Now, let's look at a couple of alternatives. You might use "select" or "decide on". Both could be slotted into our examples with similar meaning. However, "select" is slightly more formal, often used in written contexts like reports or formal emails. On the other hand, "decide on" is a bit more casual, and you might use it more often in spoken settings. 

So, there you have it. "Opt for" is a useful phrase expressing a confident, considered choice in the world of product management. It fits comfortably in both spoken and written English, and can be replaced with "select" or "decide on" depending on the formality level. 

Remember, language is a powerful tool in your product manager kit. Knowing how to use these phrases can help you communicate your decisions clearly and confidently. Until next time, this is Suzy from Nexus PM, helping you master the language of product management.</podcast:transcript>

  <title>Word 17 - Opt Out Of</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "opt out of". In the world of product management, 'opt out of' is a phrase we often use to express a conscious decision to not participate in something, be it a process, a task, or even a responsibility. Think of it as choosing to step away from an activity or obligation.

Now, let's delve into a couple of examples. Picture yourself in a product planning meeting. Your team has proposed a new feature that requires significant coding efforts. You could say, 'Given the current workload of our team, we might need to opt out of this feature for the next release.' Here, 'opt out of' signifies your choice not to include the feature in the upcoming product release due to constraints.

In another scenario, during a team update, your colleague might suggest, 'I've been assigned to the redesign project, but I feel my skills would be better utilized elsewhere. I'd like to opt out of this task.' In this instance, 'opt out of' communicates the desire to withdraw from a particular assignment.

'Opt out of' is commonly used in both written and spoken business communication. It's a versatile phrase that helps to maintain a professional tone while clearly expressing your decision.

Now, if you're looking for alternatives, consider 'withdraw from', 'step away from', or 'excuse oneself from'. 'Withdraw from' is slightly more formal, often used in written communication such as emails. 'Step away from', on the other hand, is more colloquial and best used in verbal exchanges. 'Excuse oneself from' is a polite way to express the same idea but implies a temporary absence and is fitting in both settings, written or spoken.

Remember, the art of communication lies in clarity and precision. And the phrase 'opt out of' and its alternatives allow you to express your decision with both. That's all for today on Nexus PM, where we make business English a breeze. Until our next episode, keep communicating confidently!"</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "opt in to." 

In the context of product management in the UK, "opt in to" means to choose to be part of something or to participate in a specific initiative or feature. It?s about making a decision to join or engage willingly, rather than being automatically included. This phrase is often used when discussing features, updates, or programs where users or team members can select their participation.

For example, imagine you?re in a product meeting discussing a new feature for your app?a newsletter that provides users with updates and tips. You might say, ?We want to give our users the choice to opt in to receive our newsletter.? Here, you?re indicating that users can decide for themselves whether they want to receive that information, rather than forcing it upon everyone.

Another situation could be during a team update, where you might want your team members to feel engaged with a new project initiative. You could say, ?For our next sprint, we?d like everyone to opt in to the brainstorming sessions if they're interested.? This invites your team to join voluntarily, giving them the agency to decide what they want to take part in.

Using "opt in to" not only simplifies communication but also shows respect for others' choices. It?s a great way to empower users and team members within the product development process.

To recap, when you say "opt in to," remember you?re inviting someone to choose to be involved in something. It reflects a collaborative spirit and encourages participation, which is so vital in product management.

In a UK product management context, "expose to" means to introduce someone to new ideas, products, or experiences. It?s about providing people the opportunity to learn or interact with something that they may not be familiar with. This is key in product management, where understanding the market and customer needs is crucial for successful development.

Let?s imagine you?re working on a new feature for a mobile app. In a team meeting, you might say, "I think we should expose the team to some user feedback from our recent tests." Here, you?re suggesting that the team should look at this feedback to understand the users better and improve the product.

Another example could be during a product planning session. You might say, "To ensure our product meets corporate needs, let's expose our stakeholders to some international best practices." In this case, you're indicating that by reviewing these practices, your team can gain valuable insights that will help shape your product?s success.

By using "expose to" in these contexts, you help create a collaborative environment where everyone can learn from each other. It?s a great way to suggest sharing knowledge and experiences, which is key in product management roles.

To wrap up, remember that "expose to" is about introducing and allowing access to new ideas and experiences. It fosters learning and collaboration, which are essential in the world of product management.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "perceive." 

In the context of product management, to "perceive" means how someone understands or interprets something based on their own experiences and feelings. It?s about how we view a product, a feature, or even customer feedback. Understanding how different people perceive things is essential in our role as product managers because it helps us design products that meet the needs of our users and stakeholders.

For instance, imagine you?re in a product meeting discussing a new app feature. You might say, "I perceive that our users find the current onboarding process a bit overwhelming." In this case, you?re sharing your view based on your understanding of user feedback. By saying "I perceive," you acknowledge that this is your assessment and it opens up the conversation for others to share their views, creating a collaborative atmosphere.

Another example could be during a feature planning session. You might express, "I perceive that our team is excited about the new design, but I also sense some concern about implementation timelines." Here, you demonstrate your awareness of the different feelings within the team, which can help address any anxieties and guide the planning process more effectively.

When we use "perceive," we invite discussion and encourage others to share their thoughts. This word not only helps to convey our understanding but also emphasizes that perceptions can vary. 

So remember, "perceive" is a valuable term in your product management toolkit. It helps you communicate your insights while inviting others to share their perspectives too, creating a richer dialogue.

When we say "in this regard," we are talking about a specific aspect or area of a topic we just mentioned.

For example, let's imagine you?re in a product meeting discussing a new feature for your application. You might say, "We've received feedback about the user interface, and in this regard, we should prioritize improving its accessibility." Here, you're highlighting that the feedback specifically relates to the user interface, making your point clear and focused.

Another situation could be during a team update. Let?s say a colleague asks about the progress on the project timeline.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "miss from." 

In the context of product management in the UK, "miss from" refers to something that is not included or overlooked in a particular context. It?s often used when discussing features, updates, or tasks that should have been part of a plan or timeline but were either forgotten or not accounted for. Understanding how to use this term confidently can help you communicate more clearly with your team and stakeholders.

Let?s dive into a couple of examples. Imagine you're in a product planning meeting. You might say, ?I think we?ve missed a crucial user feedback report from our last sprint review.? In this sentence, you?re indicating that an important piece of information wasn?t included when you assessed the work done. It?s a gentle way of highlighting a gap without placing blame.

Another scenario might occur during a team update. You could say, ?We seem to have missed the marketing strategy from our presentation. We need to address that in our next meeting.? Here, you?re acknowledging that a key element related to marketing was overlooked, which is important for your product?s success.

So, "miss from" is useful when you want to indicate that something has been unintentionally left out in discussions or planning. It helps you address potential issues while maintaining a collaborative atmosphere.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is questionable.

In the UK, the term ?questionable? is often used to describe something that raises doubts or could be seen as unreliable. In a product management context, it can refer to decisions, data, or even features that might not be fully justified or whose effectiveness is uncertain.

Let?s say you?re in a product meeting discussing an upcoming feature for your app. One of your colleagues presents a new design, but you notice that the user feedback on a similar design was not very positive. You might say, ?I think the user feedback for this design is somewhat questionable. Perhaps we should explore other options or look for additional data before moving forward.? 

In another scenario, imagine you?re reviewing sales data for your new product. If the numbers show a sudden drop that isn?t clear, you could share your concerns with the team by saying, ?The reasons behind this drop seem questionable. We should investigate further to understand what might be causing it.? 

In both examples, using ?questionable? helps communicate that you have concerns and that the information may need further exploration. It shows that you?re thinking critically about the subject at hand, which is a key skill for a product manager.

So, remember, when you find something that doesn?t seem right or is unclear, describing it as questionable can be a constructive way to express your thoughts. It opens the door for discussion and deeper investigation.

In a UK product management context, saying "my understanding on" is a way to express your perspective or interpretation of a situation, idea, or topic. It?s like saying, ?This is how I see things.?

This conveys your grasp of the situation and invites others to share their thoughts.

Another scenario could be during a team update.

In the context of product management, "deliberate" means to do something intentionally and with careful thought. It?s about making decisions after thoroughly considering the consequences and benefits.

Let?s look at a couple of examples. Imagine you are in a product meeting where your team discusses the launch of a new feature. You might say, "I think we should take a deliberate approach to this launch, ensuring we test the feature thoroughly before going live." In this case, you?re suggesting that everyone should be thoughtful and careful, ensuring that nothing is rushed.

Another example could be during a team update where you?re sharing progress on a product. You might explain, "Our team made a deliberate decision to focus on user feedback in the next sprint." Here, you are emphasizing that the choice to prioritize user feedback was made after careful consideration, not just as an impulse.

This phrase is commonly used in business and especially in product management discussions here in the UK. It helps us explore the level or degree of something, which is very important when we're making decisions about products or features.

Another example could be during a team update. Imagine you?re sharing the results from a user survey. You could say, "To what extent did users find the current product layout intuitive?" This question allows your team to focus on specific feedback and consider how they can improve the user experience based on that information.

Remember, using ?to what extent? is a great way to encourage deeper thinking and clarity in discussions. It invites others to consider not just if something works, but how well it works, or to what degree it meets our goals.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "near the saturation point." 

In the context of product management in the UK, "near the saturation point" refers to a stage where a market or a product has reached its maximum potential in terms of sales or usage. When we say something is near the saturation point, we mean that there are fewer new customers or users to attract, and most of the potential audience has been reached. 

Let?s imagine you?re in a product meeting discussing a popular fitness app. You might say, "Our user growth has been steady, but I think we are near the saturation point in the UK. It's time to consider expanding our features or targeting new markets to keep up momentum." This shows your team that you understand the current state of the market, and it helps to plan next steps wisely.

In another example, during a team update, you might mention, "Sales of our current model are strong, but the market is near the saturation point. We should begin planning for the next version to ensure we stay ahead of our competitors." This indicates that you're aware of market dynamics and proactive in your approach.

To wrap up, remember that "near the saturation point" is a useful phrase to express when a product or market is about to stop growing significantly. It's a great way to signal the need for innovation or expansion.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is compelling evidences. 

In the world of product management, particularly here in the UK, "compelling evidences" refers to data or information that strongly supports an argument or decision. It?s what helps convince your team, stakeholders, or even customers that your ideas are worth pursuing. These can be statistics, user feedback, market research, or case studies?anything that shows that what you?re proposing has a solid foundation. 

For example, imagine you?re in a product meeting discussing a new feature for your app. You might say, ?I believe we should add a dark mode to our application. The compelling evidences show that users reported a 30% increase in satisfaction when using apps with this feature.? Here, you?re not only sharing your idea but also backing it up with strong data that makes your point more persuasive.

Another example could be in a team update when discussing user growth.

By using "compelling evidences," you are making it clear that your conclusions are based on substantial proof.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "weigh the trade-offs." 

In the UK product management context, "weigh the trade-offs" means to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of different options before making a decision. It?s about understanding that every choice comes with some benefits and some costs, and it's important to balance them to find the best solution for your product or team.

For example, let?s imagine you are in a product meeting discussing a new feature for your app. You might say, ?We could add this feature, but we need to weigh the trade-offs. It will take significant development time, and we must consider how it affects our current timeline.? Here, you are highlighting the benefit of the new feature against the potential delay it could cause.

Another common situation could be during team updates. You might say, ?As we plan for the next release, we need to weigh the trade-offs between adding more features and ensuring the stability of our product.? In this case, you?re helping the team think about whether it?s better to focus on new features or to improve the existing ones. Both choices have their pros and cons, and discussing them allows the team to make informed decisions.

So, remember, "weigh the trade-offs" is about finding the best path forward by considering both sides of any decision. It shows your critical thinking skills and helps build a collaborative discussion with your team.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is clawback risks. 

In the UK business context, "clawback risks" refers to the possibility that a company may have to retrieve or ?claw back? money that has already been paid out, usually because certain conditions were not met. This can happen with bonuses, investments, or even product performance targets. Understanding clawback risks is important for Product Managers as it helps in making sound decisions that align financial expectations with actual outcomes.

Let me give you an example. Imagine you?re in a product meeting discussing a new feature launch for a popular app. You?ve outlined a potential bonus for the team that?s tied to product performance. However, if the product doesn't perform as expected?perhaps due to technical issues or a lack of user interest?there?s a risk you'll need to claw back those bonus payments. So, you might say, "While we want to motivate the team, we need to be aware of the clawback risks associated with our performance incentives.? 

Another example could be during a feature planning session. You?re discussing a partnership with another company and you?ve committed to certain revenue targets. If those targets aren?t met, you may face clawback risks regarding any upfront payments made to your partner. You could frame it like this: ?Before we finalize our partnership, let?s assess the clawback risks if we fall short of our revenue goals.?

So, to wrap up, "clawback risks" is an important concept to understand in product management, especially in discussions involving financial incentives or investments. It represents the potential need to reclaim funds if targets aren?t met, reminding us to balance ambition with realistic expectations.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "whilst." 

In the UK, "whilst" is a lovely word that means "while." It?s often used in formal or business contexts, and it can add a touch of sophistication to your language. In product management, using "whilst" can help clarify timelines, actions, or contrasts between ideas.

Imagine you are in a product meeting discussing the upcoming launch of a new feature. You might say, "We need to finalize the design this week, whilst also making sure the team is aligned on the marketing strategy." Here, "whilst" shows that these two important tasks need to happen at the same time.

Another example could be during a team update. You might say, "Our development team is focused on improving the user interface, whilst the analytics team is gathering user feedback." This use of "whilst" emphasizes that both teams are working on important tasks that complement each other.

Remember, "whilst" can not only show that two actions are happening simultaneously, but it can also add clarity when discussing different perspectives or ideas. 

So when you're in meetings or during team discussions, don?t hesitate to use "whilst" to express simultaneous ideas or actions. It will help you sound more fluent and connected to British English.

So, what does "albeit" mean in our world of product management? Simply put, it?s a small but powerful word that means ?although? or ?even though.? We use it to introduce a contrast or to acknowledge something while still making a point. It helps us convey nuances in our discussions, which is very important in product management, especially here in the UK.

Let?s imagine you?re in a product review meeting. You might say, ?The feedback from our beta users has been very positive, albeit with some concerns regarding the app's user interface.? In this case, you?re highlighting that while the feedback is generally good, there are still some issues to address. It shows that you can recognize the positive while also acknowledging the negatives ? a key skill for any product manager.

Another example could be during a feature planning session. You might say, ?We plan to launch the new feature next month, albeit it may not include all the enhancements we originally intended.? Here, you?re setting expectations. You want your team to be aware that while there?s a plan in place, there will be some limitations. Using ?albeit? here adds a layer of sophistication to your communication.

By incorporating "albeit" into your vocabulary, you articulate your thoughts more clearly and demonstrate your ability to engage with complex ideas. It?s a great way to show that you?re thoughtful and considerate of different aspects of a situation.

In a UK product management context, "team up" means to collaborate or work together with others to achieve a common goal. As a product manager, you often find yourself needing to combine your skills and ideas with those of your colleagues. This collaboration is essential in developing successful products.

Here, you are encouraging everyone to come together and share their thoughts, creating a sense of unity as you all work towards a productive outcome.

Another example could be during a team update.

This shows your willingness to collaborate and ensures that both teams can make the most of their resources.

So, whenever you use "team up," remember it?s about joining forces with others. This could be within your department, across teams, or even with external partners. It emphasizes cooperation and a shared mission.

In a UK product and business context, "in favour" means to support or prefer one option over another. It?s often used to express agreement or preference during discussions, especially when making choices about products or features.

You might say, ?I am in favour of enhancing the user interface because it will improve user satisfaction and retention.? This clearly shows your support for improving the user interface over adding a new feature.

In another scenario, during a team update, you could say, ?The feedback we?ve received is overwhelmingly in favour of launching the new marketing campaign next quarter.? Here, you?re highlighting that many people support that particular decision.

Using "in favour" not only communicates your preference, but also helps foster a collaborative atmosphere, as it invites others to share their perspectives and encourages a healthy discussion.

In a UK product management context, "undesirable" refers to something that is not wanted or is seen as a problem.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is nuance. 

In the UK business context, especially in product management, nuance refers to the subtle differences and complexities in ideas, opinions, or product features. Understanding nuance is essential because it helps you appreciate the different perspectives of your team members, users, and stakeholders. It?s all about recognizing that things are not always black and white but can have many shades in between. 

For example, let?s say you?re in a product meeting discussing a new feature for your app. One team member might propose a simple design, while another might suggest a more feature-rich approach. As the Product Manager, you should acknowledge the nuances between both ideas. You might say, ?I see the value in both suggestions. The simple design appeals to users looking for ease of use, while the richer features can cater to those needing more robust options.? By highlighting these nuances, you foster a collaborative atmosphere where everyone feels heard, even if their ideas differ.

Another scenario could be during team updates. Perhaps the marketing team shares feedback from users who want more customization options. Instead of just taking the feedback at face value, you could explore the nuance by asking, ?What kind of customization do our users need exactly? Are we talking about changing colors, or are they looking for deeper functionality?? This deeper understanding not only helps your team prioritize development but also shows your critical thinking skills.

So, when you use the word 'nuance', think about those subtle differences that could make a significant impact on your product?s success. Remember, it?s not just about the obvious choices, but also about exploring those intricate, layered details that matter in product development and team dynamics.

In a UK product management context, to "cross reference" means to compare information or data from different sources to ensure accuracy or to draw connections. It?s like creating a bridge between two pieces of information to see how they relate or support each other. This term is especially useful in discussions about product features, user feedback, or market research. 

For example, imagine you?re in a product meeting discussing a new feature for your app. You might say, "Let?s cross reference the feedback from our users with the data we collected from market research." By doing this, you're ensuring that the insights you're using to guide your decisions are consistent and reliable. You?re not just relying on one set of information; you?re combining different perspectives to make a better-informed decision.

Another situation could be during a feature planning session. You might want to confirm that the development team is on the same page. You could say, "Before we finalize the requirements, let?s cross reference our notes from last week?s team update with the latest user stories." This shows your colleagues that you value thoroughness and want to ensure that everything aligns before moving forward.

So, remember, to "cross reference" means to diligently compare and connect information from multiple sources. It's a vital skill in product management to maintain accuracy and ensure you're making well-informed decisions based on comprehensive data.

In the context of product management in the UK, the term "obligation" refers to a responsibility or a duty that you are expected to fulfill. It often relates to commitments made to customers, stakeholders, or your own team. Understanding how to use this word can help you communicate your responsibilities clearly and confidently.

For example, imagine you're in a product planning meeting, discussing the launch of a new feature. You might say, "We have an obligation to our users to ensure that this feature meets their needs." Here, you're highlighting the responsibility your team has towards the users, which is essential for building trust and delivering a valuable product.

Another example could be during a team update. You might state, "As the lead on this project, I have an obligation to keep everyone informed about our progress." This shows you're aware of your duty to keep your team updated, and it emphasizes your commitment to collaboration and transparency.

Remember, using "obligation" can help convey a sense of responsibility and professionalism in your discussions. It reinforces the idea that you take your commitments seriously, whether to users, stakeholders, or colleagues.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is adjacency to. 

Now, let's explore what "adjacency to" means, especially in the context of business and product management here in the UK. When we talk about "adjacency to," we?re referring to how close or related a product, feature, or market is to another. It helps us to assess connections and opportunities that may exist alongside our current offerings. For example, when a product team discusses expanding their product line, they might think about adjacent markets ? that is, market spaces that are similar or close to what they are already working on.

Imagine you're in a product meeting where your team is brainstorming new features for a mobile app. You might say, ?We should consider the adjacency to social media integrations. Many users are looking for ways to share their experiences directly within the app.? Here, you?re identifying a related area that could enhance your product by tapping into connections users already value.

Another scenario might be during a team update. You could express, ?Our latest user feedback shows a strong adjacency to e-commerce functionalities.? This indicates that you see a link between what your users want and what your team can deliver, highlighting an opportunity for growth or improvement.

Using "adjacency to" in these contexts not only helps clarify your thoughts but also positions you as a strategic thinker who understands the broader landscape of your products. Remember, this phrase is about finding and leveraging connections that can enrich what you're currently doing.

So, when you think about growth opportunities or feature enhancements, consider how they relate to existing elements. This approach will help you communicate more effectively and confidently in your role.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is gear. 

In a business context, especially in the UK product management world, "gear" refers to the tools, processes, or approaches you use to accomplish your goals. It?s about the way you prepare your team and resources to move forward with a project or a task. Just like how a car needs the right gear to drive smoothly, in product management, having the right gear helps your team operate efficiently and effectively.

Let?s think about a couple of examples to make this clearer. Imagine you?re in a product meeting where the team is discussing the launch of a new feature. You might say, "To ensure we?re all on the same page, we need to gear up for our user testing next week." Here, "gear up" means preparing or getting ready to conduct the testing. It?s about making sure everyone knows their part and has the tools they need.

In another scenario, during a team update, you might hear someone say, "This week, we need to gear our efforts towards improving our customer feedback process." In this case, "gear your efforts" describes focusing the team?s energy and resources on a specific area.

So, ?gear? is quite a versatile word in business. You can use it when talking about preparation, tools, or even strategies. It?s all about aligning your resources and making sure the team is ready for what?s ahead.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is tweak.

In the world of product management, especially here in the UK, "tweak" is a really useful term. It means to make small adjustments or changes to something. These changes often help to improve a product or fix minor issues without making major overhauls. Think of it as fine-tuning your work to make it just right.

Let?s imagine you?re in a product meeting, discussing the latest feature for your app. Perhaps your team has gathered feedback from users, and they feel that the button size is a bit too small. You could say, ?I think we should tweak the button size to make it easier for users to click.? This shows you understand the feedback and are ready to make a small change that can enhance the user experience.

Another example could be during a team update. You might report, ?We?ve seen some good results from the last update, but let?s tweak the onboarding process based on the new insights we have.? Here, you?re suggesting a minor adjustment to improve the way new users get acquainted with the product.

Remember, using the word "tweak" conveys an approachable attitude. It indicates that you?re responsive to input and willing to improve things gradually. It?s not about making big changes; it?s about those little refinements that can lead to greater success.

So, when you're discussing improvements or adjustments in your role as a Product Manager, don?t hesitate to use "tweak." It?s a friendly and effective way to express your ideas.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is ?untangle.? 

In the UK business and product management context, ?untangle? means to clarify or sort out complex issues or problems. It's like when you're working on a puzzle, and you need to figure out how the pieces connect. As product managers, we often deal with intricate scenarios involving team dynamics, customer needs, and technical challenges. To "untangle" these situations means to break them down into simpler parts, so we can see what needs to be done.

Let?s imagine you?re in a product meeting with your team, and there?s confusion around the upcoming feature launch. You might say, ?Let?s untangle the timelines for each team?s deliverables so we can all stay on the same page.? This not only shows your leadership in clarifying the situation but also helps everyone understand their roles more clearly.

Another scenario could be during a team update. You might hear a colleague describing feedback from users regarding the product and saying, ?We need to untangle what the most critical user complaints are, so we can prioritize them effectively.? This approach helps the team focus on what truly matters, rather than getting lost in the details.

So, remember that "untangle" is all about clarifying complex issues. Whether you?re in meetings or discussing priorities, using this word can help you communicate clearly and assertively, allowing your team to navigate challenges more effectively.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is low fidelity wireframes. 

So, what exactly does this term mean? In the world of product management, low fidelity wireframes are simple, sketch-like representations of a product?s layout and functionality. They are usually created early in the design process to display ideas and concepts without getting bogged down in details. Think of them as a blueprint for a building, where the focus is on the structure rather than the finishes.

Let?s picture a scenario. Imagine you?re in a product meeting discussing a new app feature. You might say, ?We?ll create some low fidelity wireframes to map out how the user will interact with this feature.? This shows your team that you're thinking about the user's experience, and it sets a clear path for the next steps in the project.

Now, here?s another example. Suppose you?re giving a team update. You could mention, ?Based on the low fidelity wireframes we reviewed last week, I?ve gathered feedback and made some adjustments.? This not only demonstrates your collaborative approach but also reinforces your understanding of the development process.

In summary, low fidelity wireframes are essential tools that help teams visualize ideas early on, making communication smoother and more effective. They?re quick to create, easy to revise, and allow everyone to contribute to the design process without getting lost in details.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "take something on."

In the UK business context, especially for product managers, "take something on" means to accept a responsibility or to start working on a new task or project. It can refer to tasks that are new, additional, or sometimes even challenging. Being able to use this phrase can show your willingness to contribute and help your team succeed.

Let?s look at a couple of examples to paint a clearer picture. Imagine you?re in a product meeting discussing an upcoming feature for your app. Your manager might say, ?I think we need someone to take on the responsibility of conducting user research to understand our customers better.? In this case, your manager is looking for someone to step up and handle that important task.

Another example could occur during team updates. You might hear a colleague say, ?I?ve decided to take on the project of improving our onboarding process.? This shows that the colleague is willing to accept this new challenge, which is vital for team growth and product success.

So, when you use "take something on," you?re indicating that you are ready to accept a new responsibility or task, and it?s often seen as a positive thing. It suggests initiative and a proactive attitude, which are essential traits for anyone looking to advance in a product management role.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "knuckle down." 

In the UK, when we say "knuckle down," we mean to focus and work hard on a task or project, especially when it's important or challenging. It?s about putting in the effort and getting serious to meet deadlines or achieve goals. In the fast-paced world of product management, this phrase can be quite useful. 

Let?s imagine you?re in a product meeting with your team. You?ve just received some feedback from users, and it?s clear that there are some critical issues that need fixing. You might say, "Okay team, it?s time to knuckle down and address these user concerns. We need to prioritize our tasks and really focus on delivering a great experience for our customers." 

Or perhaps you?re in a feature planning session, discussing what to include in the next release. The deadline is approaching, and everyone has ideas, but the team is slightly scattered. You could say, "I think we need to knuckle down on defining the scope of our features so we can stick to our timeline." This shows your colleagues that you understand the importance of clarity and focus as the deadline draws nearer.

By using "knuckle down" in these contexts, you?re conveying both urgency and determination. It's a friendly way to encourage your teammates to jump into the hard work ahead.

Remember, "knuckle down" is a great expression to show you?re committed to tackling challenges head-on. By incorporating this phrase into your communication, you?ll express a proactive attitude that is highly valued in business, especially in product management roles.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "At the turn of." 

So, what does this phrase mean in the context of product management and business in the UK? "At the turn of" is often used to refer to a significant change or transition that happens at a specific time, especially when it relates to new developments, trends, or shifts in a project or product lifecycle. It?s a great way to signal that something important is happening or has just happened. 

For example, imagine you?re in a product meeting discussing the future of a software tool your team is developing. You might say, ?At the turn of last quarter, we noticed a shift in our user feedback, indicating that customers were asking for more customization options.? This highlights that a significant change occurred at the beginning of that quarter, which can guide your team?s focus moving forward.

Another example could be during a feature planning session. You might express, ?At the turn of the year, we decided to pivot our strategy based on the latest market research. This has set the stage for our new features to better meet user needs.? Here, you?re emphasizing a pivotal moment that significantly impacted your product direction.

So, in summary, "At the turn of" is a useful phrase that helps you communicate about key moments of change or decision-making in your product journey. It connects different points in time and highlights their importance to your audience, making your updates or insights feel more impactful.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "claim". In a product or business context, "claim" is a powerful word, often used to express a firm belief in the effectiveness, success, or benefits of a product, feature, or strategy. It's about making a statement that something is true, even if you may not have the evidence to prove it at the moment.

Imagine you're in a product meeting, and you firmly believe that a new feature you are developing will increase user engagement. You might say, "We claim that the new feature will boost user engagement by 30%." You're defining a goal and expressing confidence in your product's ability to meet it. Or perhaps in a team update, you might hear, "Our marketing team claims that the new ad campaign will improve our brand visibility significantly."

Remember, when you "claim" something, you're not just guessing, you're expressing a belief based on your knowledge, expertise, and analysis. It's a word used in both spoken and written settings, from casual team chats to formal written reports.

Now, let's look at a couple of similar words. "Assert" is a great alternative. When you "assert" something, you state it confidently and forcefully. It can be used in the same scenarios as "claim". Another one is "maintain". When you "maintain" an opinion, you firmly uphold it over time. These words, like "claim", can be used in both spoken and written settings.

So, in your journey as an international professional preparing for a Product Manager role, remember the power of "claim", "assert", and "maintain". They help you communicate confidence, belief, and commitment to your product's success. That?s all for today's Nexus PM vocabulary lesson.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "bar". In the product and business world, "bar" isn't just a place where you grab a pint. "Bar" is a versatile word often used to signify barring or excluding something, or it can also indicate with the exception of something. 

Let's say you're in a product planning meeting and your team is discussing the launch of a new software. Your lead developer might say, "We're ready to roll out the new software, bar any major bugs that show up in the final testing phase." Here, "bar" is used to mean "unless there are any major bugs". 

Similarly, in a team update, you might hear: "All teams are on track to meet their targets, bar the design team who are dealing with a few unexpected setbacks." In this instance, 'bar' is used to mean 'except for'. 

"Bar" is a handy little word that's used in both written and spoken English settings. It's a straightforward way to convey exceptions or potential obstacles in a plan, without having to use multiple words or phrases.

Now, if you're looking to mix up your language a bit, you might use alternatives like "except for", "unless", or "excluding". These all work in similar contexts as "bar". "Except for" is probably the most common and can be used in both written and spoken English. It's a tad more formal, so you might use it in a written report or a formal presentation. 

"Unless" is more casual and is often used in spoken English. For instance, in a more relaxed team meeting, you might say, "We're all set for the product launch unless we run into any last-minute hitches."

"Excluding" is a bit more specific and is often used in written English, especially when you're talking about data or numbers. For instance, you might write in a report, "Sales have been strong this quarter, excluding a slight dip in April."

So there you have it, the word "bar" can be a useful tool in your business English arsenal. Remember, it's all about context. You can use "bar" or its alternatives to make your communication more precise and clear. Until next time, keep learning and expanding your vocabulary.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: 'different to'. In the realm of product management and business, 'different to' is a phrase used to highlight distinctions that set one entity apart from another. This could be a product, a strategy, or even a business approach.

Imagine being in a product meeting where you're discussing a new feature of your product. You might say, 'Our user interface is different to that of our competitors. It's more user-friendly and intuitive.' Here, 'different to' is used to highlight the unique selling point of your product, setting it apart from the competition.

Or perhaps, during a team update, you're explaining a change in strategy. You could say, 'Our approach to customer service is now different to what it was last quarter. We're focusing more on personalisation and less on automation.' In this setting, 'different to' helps to emphasize the shift in your strategy.

'Different to' is versatile. It can be used in both spoken and written settings, making it a valuable addition to your business English vocabulary.

Now, let's look at some alternative phrases. 'Unlike' and 'as opposed to' can also be used in similar contexts. For instance, 'Unlike our competitors, we offer 24/7 customer support.' or 'We're focusing on personalisation as opposed to automation.' 

'Unlike' is less formal and more commonly used in spoken communication, though it can be used in writing too. 'As opposed to', on the other hand, is slightly more formal and is often found in written documents, but it's perfectly acceptable in spoken English as well. 

Remember, these phrases all serve the same purpose - to highlight differences. 'Different to', 'unlike', and 'as opposed to' are your tools to confidently express contrast in the business world. 

So, the next time you're in a product meeting or team update, don't hesitate to use 'different to' or its alternatives to clearly communicate your points of difference. Thank you for joining me today on Nexus PM with Suzy. Until next time, keep communicating with confidence!"</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "on the flip side". This phrase is often used in business contexts to introduce an opposing or contrasting viewpoint. It?s like saying, "But let?s look at this from another angle," or "Here?s the other side of the coin". 

Let's dive into some examples and see how it works in the real world. 

Imagine you're in a product meeting, discussing the launch of a new feature. You might say, ?Our data shows that customers are demanding this feature. However, on the flip side, our engineers are concerned about the technical challenges and potential delays in delivery." 

In another scenario, during a team update, you might say, ?Our product has received excellent reviews for its user-friendly interface. On the flip side, we've had some negative feedback about our customer service response times." This phrase helps you to balance your communication, and it?s a great way to introduce constructive criticism or potential areas for improvement.

Now, is this phrase more common in written or spoken English? The answer is both! You'll find it in emails and reports as well as in meetings and presentations. 

If you're looking for alternatives, consider "on the other hand", "alternatively", or even "however". These words are just as versatile, but be aware, "however" is a bit more formal, and best used in written communications, while "on the other hand" and "alternatively" are perfect for both spoken and written contexts.

So, to recap, "on the flip side" is a handy phrase to introduce a contrasting viewpoint or an alternate perspective. It's widely used in both spoken and written English, and is a favourite among product managers for its ability to balance discussions and ideas. 

That's all for today's episode. Remember, the more you use these phrases, the more confident you'll become in your business English communication. This is Nexus PM with Suzy, wishing you success in your product management journey!"</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "neglect". Let's dive straight into the fascinating world of product management, shall we?

In a business or product context, "neglect" refers to the failure to care for something properly, or not giving enough attention to a particular matter. It's a word that's used to discuss issues that have been overlooked or ignored, often leading to negative consequences. 

Imagine this, you're in a product meeting and there's a feature that's been causing some minor bugs. It's on the agenda but it's always being postponed because there are seemingly more pressing matters. Over time, these minor bugs evolve into major issues that negatively affect user experience. You could say, "We've neglected this feature for too long and now it's causing serious problems."

Or perhaps, during a team update, you might say, "We cannot neglect the feedback from our users about the recent update. We need to address their concerns promptly."

So, in essence, "neglect" is a word that encapsulates an oversight or the lack of attention given to something important. It's used in both spoken and written settings. 

Now, let's explore some alternatives to "neglect" that can be used in similar contexts. The word "ignore" is one, meaning to refuse to take notice of or acknowledge something. It's quite similar to "neglect", but with a slightly stronger connotation of deliberately choosing not to deal with something, often used in both spoken and written English.

Another alternative is "overlook", which means to fail to notice something. This word is subtly different, as it suggests unintentional missing of details rather than a conscious decision to ignore or neglect. It's also used in both spoken and written communication.

So, remember, in your journey as a product manager, don't "neglect", "ignore", or "overlook" anything that can impact your product or service. Keep your eyes open, attention sharp, and remember to address all issues promptly and effectively. This will not only resolve problems faster but also build trust within your team and with your users.

That's all for today's Nexus PM vocabulary session. Let's continue building our communication skills together. </podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "pivot". This term is frequently used in the business world, especially in product management. In a business context, a 'pivot' is a fundamental shift in strategy that helps a company adapt to unforeseen situations or changes in the market. It's like a dancer performing a pivot move ? they're still on the dance floor, but they're changing direction.

Imagine you're leading a meeting about a new product feature. After weeks of planning, you realise this feature isn't resonating with your target market. Instead of pushing forward, you might say, 'Given the feedback from our market research, it's clear we need to pivot our strategy and explore different feature options.' You're not abandoning the product, you're merely shifting your approach.

Or consider a team update scenario. If the project isn't meeting its goals, you might tell your team, 'We need to pivot from our current approach and try a different tactic.' This word is most commonly used in spoken settings like these, but you might also see it in written communications like emails or project plans.

Some alternative words that convey a similar idea include 'shift', 'switch', or 'transition'. 'Shift' and 'switch' are more casual, often used in spoken communication. 'Transition', on the other hand, is a bit more formal and you might see it more in written contexts. All of these words imply a change, but 'pivot' uniquely captures the need for a strategic change while maintaining the core objective.

So, remember, when things don't go as planned, don't panic. Instead, consider if it's time to pivot. It's not about giving up, but about adapting and finding a new direction that works better.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: 'size the effort.' This phrase is a common one in product management and business settings across the globe. In essence, it refers to the process of evaluating or estimating the amount of work, time, resources - essentially the 'effort' - that will be required to complete a particular task or project. 

Imagine you?re in a product planning meeting. Your team is discussing a new feature, and your manager might say, 'Before we move forward, we need to size the effort.' They're asking the team to gauge how much work is involved before deciding whether it?s feasible. 

Or, perhaps you're giving a team update. You might say, 'We?ve sized the effort for the redesign, and it appears it will take us about three weeks.' In this case, you have assessed the task at hand and are providing an estimation.

'Size the effort' is a phrase that is commonly used in both written and spoken communication. You'll hear it in meetings, read it in emails, and use it in your day-to-day work as a product manager.

Now, what if you want to switch it up a bit? No problem. There are a few alternatives you can use. 'Estimate the effort' is one, and it carries a similar meaning. 'Gauge the workload' is another. While they might have slightly different connotations, they all aim at understanding the amount of work required for a task. These phrases are also used in both spoken and written contexts. 

Remember, 'size the effort' is about assessing and communicating the scope of work. It's a handy phrase to have in your English vocabulary arsenal, especially in the product management world. So, go ahead, add it to your daily lexicon and size the effort with confidence!

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s topic: "in a good shape / place / position". Now, this phrase is often used in a business or product context to indicate that a project, product, or even a team, is progressing well and is ready for the next stages. It suggests that everything is in order, on track, and well-prepared.

Let's dive into a couple of examples to make this crystal clear. 

Imagine you're in a product meeting discussing the latest software update. Your team has been working tirelessly, squashing bugs and refining features. You might say, "Our software is in a good shape for the launch next week". This means the software is functioning as it should, and you're confident about the upcoming launch.

Or perhaps it's a team update meeting. Your team has been performing exceptionally well, meeting all their targets. You might report, "The team is in a good place to take on the new project". This indicates that your team is ready and capable to handle new challenges.

This phrase, "in a good shape / place / position", is commonly used in both written and spoken settings, making it a versatile tool in your English language toolkit.

Now, let's consider some alternatives. You could say something or someone is "well-prepared", "ready", or "set". These words convey a similar meaning but with slight nuances. "Well-prepared" implies thorough preparation, "ready" suggests complete readiness, and "set" implies readiness for immediate action. These alternatives, like our main phrase, can be used in both written and spoken English.

In conclusion, the phrase "in a good shape / place / position" is a handy way to express that a project, product, or team is ready for the next step or challenge. It's a positive phrase that conveys confidence and readiness. So, try using it in your next business meeting or written communication, and you'll sound just like a native English speaker. Until next time, this is Nexus PM with Suzy, helping you communicate with confidence in the world of Product Management."

  <title>Word 63 - Get To Where We're Meant To Be</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s phrase is "get to where we're meant to be." This phrase is like a compass guiding us towards our goals, especially in the context of product or business management. 

Imagine you're managing a project with multiple stages, from ideation to launch. Each stage has its own objectives. When you say "we need to get to where we're meant to be," you're emphasizing the importance of meeting those objectives and moving forward to the next stage. It's a polite yet firm way to keep everyone on track and focused on what needs to be done. 

For instance, in a product meeting, you might say: "We've made great progress with the design, but we still need to get to where we're meant to be in terms of marketing and sales strategies." In this context, you're identifying an area that requires further attention and action.

Or during a team update, you might say: "Our feature development is going well. However, to get to where we're meant to be, we need to accelerate our testing process." Here, you're acknowledging good work but also highlighting the need for improvement in another area. 

This phrase is generally used in spoken settings, like meetings or presentations, but you can also use it in written communications such as emails or reports.

Alternative phrases include: "reach our target," "arrive at our goal," or "get to our intended destination." These phrases carry similar meanings but may have slight nuances. "Arrive at our goal" can imply a final destination or end point, whereas "get to our intended destination" suggests a journey with multiple stops along the way. 

Like our original phrase, these alternatives can be used in both spoken and written contexts, allowing you to vary your language while keeping your message clear.

In sum, "get to where we're meant to be" is a powerful phrase that encourages progress and goal-orientation. So the next time you want to inspire your team to keep moving forward, why not give it a try? That?s it for today. Remember: Language is a tool, use it effectively to reach your goals. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Until next time!"

  <title>Word 64 - No Appetite To Do Something</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "no appetite to do something". Now, this may sound like we're talking about lunch plans, but in fact, in the world of Product Management and business, this phrase takes on a different meaning altogether. 

When we say there's 'no appetite' to do something, we're essentially saying there's a lack of interest or willingness to undertake a particular task or pursue a certain course of action. It's a polite, businesslike way of expressing reluctance or indifference. 

Let's bring this to life with a couple of examples. Picture this: You're in a product planning meeting and someone suggests a new feature that seems risky or resource-intensive. As the Product Manager, you might say, "While I appreciate the innovative thinking, I have no appetite to invest in this feature at the moment." This communicates your current stance clearly and professionally.

Or perhaps you're providing a team update and want to address an idea that's been floating around. You might say, "Team, I understand some are keen to explore new markets, however, given our current priorities, I have no appetite to divert resources in that direction."

This phrase is equally at home in spoken and written English, making it a versatile tool in your communication arsenal. 

If you're looking for alternatives to 'no appetite', consider phrases like 'no inclination', which is a bit more formal, or 'not keen on', which is a tad more casual. Both alternatives work in spoken and written contexts, but remember, 'no inclination' may come off as slightly stiffer, while 'not keen on' has a more relaxed feel, so choose wisely based on your audience and setting.

And that's our word for today, folks. Remember, having 'no appetite' for something doesn't mean you're skipping a meal, but rather, opting out of an action or decision in the business world. Tune in next time for more business English insights.</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "be cautious about". This phrase is a gentle nudge to tread carefully, especially in situations that could have significant consequences if not handled correctly. In the business context, it often refers to the need to be alert and careful while making decisions, particularly when it comes to planning and executing product strategies. 

Let?s imagine you?re in a product meeting, and a team member proposes launching a new feature without conducting a comprehensive market analysis. You could say, "We should be cautious about implementing this feature without understanding our target market's needs." This statement signifies the need for careful consideration before taking any significant steps.

Or, during a team update, you might advise your colleagues to "be cautious about setting aggressive timelines that might compromise the quality of our product." Here, the phrase expresses the need for careful planning to ensure high product standards. 

"Be cautious about" is commonly used in both spoken and written settings, making it a versatile phrase for business communication. 

However, there are also alternative phrases that can convey similar meanings. "Be mindful of" and "be wary of" are two such examples. The former, "be mindful of", suggests a more proactive approach, encouraging one to keep something in mind throughout a process. The latter, "be wary of", implies a stronger sense of caution, almost bordering on suspicion. Both these phrases are used in both spoken and written English, giving you a range of options to choose from based on the context and the intensity of caution you wish to express. 

So, in your journey as a Product Manager, remember to "be cautious about" the decisions you make and the strategies you implement. This phrase will not only help you convey your thoughtfulness but also indicate your commitment to making well-considered choices for the benefit of your product and your team.

  <title>Word 66 - Crash</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: crash. 

In a product or business context, 'crash' is a term we often use to describe a sudden and significant failure of a system or process. It's not a word we like to hear, but it's a reality in the world of product management that we must prepare for. 

Suppose you're in a product meeting, discussing the latest version of your software. If a team member says, 'We've had a crash in the beta testing stage', they mean the software stopped working abruptly during the testing process. It's a critical issue that needs immediate attention. It's a term we often use in crisis management meetings, where we discuss how to 'prevent a crash' or 'recover from a crash'.

Let me share an example. Suppose you're giving a stakeholder update and you say, 'Despite rigorous quality assurance, our app crashed due to unexpected user behaviour. We're now working on a crash recovery plan'. This means the app stopped working due to unforeseen user actions, and you're now planning how to fix the problem.

But remember, 'crash' isn't just a word for emergencies. In project planning, we also use 'crash' in a positive way. For instance, 'crashing a schedule' means to shorten a project timeline by adding more resources. 

'Crash' is used in both spoken and written communication. It's a direct, no-nonsense word, perfect for urgent situations where clarity is key. 

However, if you're looking for alternatives, consider using 'system failure' or 'malfunction'. Both are more formal, typically used in written reports or official communication. 'Glitch' is another option, a bit less formal and more common in spoken English, often used when the problem is minor or temporary.

So there you have it. 'Crash', a small but mighty word in the product management vocabulary. Whether you're discussing a major system failure or planning to crash a schedule to meet a deadline, it's a word that gets straight to the point.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: discrepancy. Now, you might be wondering, what does discrepancy mean in the world of product management? Well, it's actually quite simple. A discrepancy is a difference or divergence between things that should match, be similar, or expected to be in harmony. 

In our daily product discussions, planning, or decisions, we might encounter discrepancies. For instance, there could be a discrepancy between what a product is designed to do and how it actually performs in reality. Or maybe there's a discrepancy between your product roadmap and the actual product development timeline. 

Here's an example: You're in a product meeting and you notice a discrepancy between the sales figures you've received and the ones reported by your finance team. You might say, "There seems to be a discrepancy in the sales figures. I'll escalate this issue to the finance department for clarification." 

Or perhaps during a stakeholder update, you notice a discrepancy between the project's timeline and the resources allocated. You could express this by saying, "There's a discrepancy between our timeline and the resources we have, we need to align our priorities to resolve this."

Discrepancy is a versatile word, used both in spoken and written communication. It's an important term in our business vocabulary, helping us to highlight and address inconsistencies in a professional and clear manner. 

Instead of 'discrepancy', you might also use words like 'inconsistency', 'divergence' or 'variance', depending on the context. 'Inconsistency' is more commonly used in spoken English and carries a slightly less formal tone, whereas 'divergence' and 'variance' are more formal and often used in written communication, especially when discussing statistical data.

Remember, the key to using these words confidently is practice. Start incorporating them into your own professional communication and observe how they're used in your workplace environment.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: Be mindful of. 

In the world of Product Management, to 'be mindful of' simply means to keep something important in your thoughts and to consider its impact as you make decisions. It's a phrase often used in product discussions, planning, and decisions, where you have to juggle multiple factors and priorities. 

Let's say you're planning a new product feature. You might hear a colleague say, 'Let's be mindful of our users' needs when we design this feature.' In this context, 'be mindful of' is an invitation to align with the priority of user satisfaction, whilst balancing other factors like cost and timeline. 

Another common scenario is in stakeholder updates. You might state, 'We've been mindful of the recent market changes, and have adjusted our roadmap accordingly.' Here, the phrase demonstrates that you've paid attention to external factors, and have adapted your plans to meet these evolving circumstances. 

'Be mindful of' is used in both spoken and written communication. It's a warm, gentle reminder rather than a strict command, making it a versatile phrase for various situations. 

A few alternative phrases to 'be mindful of' include 'keep in mind' and 'take into account'. 'Keep in mind' is a little less formal and more common in spoken English, while 'take into account' is slightly more formal and often found in written reports or emails. 

In the end, being 'mindful' in Product Management means being proactive, attuned to changes, and constantly weighing priorities. It's a phrase that encapsulates the essence of the role, and shines a light on the balance Product Managers must strike to deliver value.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: 'visibility into'. 

Now, when you hear 'visibility into' in a product management context, it refers to the level of insight or understanding one has into a particular process, project, or issue. It's about how clear you can see the details, the status, the progress, or the problems in your work. 

Think about it this way - in a foggy morning, you might not have good visibility into the distance. In the same way, in a complex project, if you don't have good 'visibility into' the project's status, you might be unsure about what's happening or what to do next. 

Let's look at a couple of examples. Imagine you're in a product roadmap meeting. You might say, 'To make sure we stay on track, we need more visibility into the development progress.' This means you want updates, reports or tools that can give you a clear picture of how far along the development is. 

Or, perhaps, during a stakeholder update, you might say, 'Our key stakeholders want more visibility into our risk mitigation strategies.' This phrase communicates that stakeholders want to understand better the steps taken to manage or reduce risks.

'Visibility into' is quite versatile and is used in both spoken and written communication. It's particularly common in discussions around planning and decision making where transparency and understanding are crucial. 

If you want to vary your language, you could use 'insight into' or 'transparency into'. 'Insight into' is a little more formal, often used in written reports, while 'transparency into' is a bit more conversational, perfect for team meetings. Both express the same idea, but with a slight shift in tone. 

So, remember, 'visibility into' is about understanding, about having a clear view of something. It's a valuable phrase to express the need for information or clarity in your product management role.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: tangible. You might have heard this word before and thought, 'Hmm, what does that actually mean in a product management context?' When we use the word ?tangible? in product discussions, we?re referring to something real or concrete, something that can be physically touched or seen. It's often used when speaking about outcomes or results that can be clearly measured or quantified.

For example, in a roadmap discussion, we might say, 'We need to focus on delivering tangible results this quarter'. Here, 'tangible results' means clear, measurable results that we can showcase to stakeholders. Or, in a product meeting, you might hear someone comment, 'The new UI has provided tangible benefits to our user experience.' In this context, 'tangible benefits' implies that the improvements are real, significant, and noticeable.

So, the word 'tangible' can add weight and substance to our conversations, making our goals, results, or benefits seem more concrete and meaningful. It's used in both spoken and written business English, but is particularly useful in presentations or reports when you need to emphasize the real-world impact or results of your work.

Now, if you want to switch things up a bit, there are a few other words you could use instead. One is 'material'. It's a bit more formal and is often used in written reports. For example, 'We've made material progress on our roadmap.' Another alternative is 'substantial', which carries a similar meaning but with a bit more emphasis on the size or amount of something. It?s often used in more informal, spoken English. For example, 'The team?s effort led to substantial improvements in user engagement.'

Remember, the key is to choose the word that best fits your context and audience. In the exciting world of product management, there?s always something tangible to talk about!

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: align with. Picture this: you're in a product planning meeting, and your colleague says, 'We need to ensure our strategies align with our end user needs.' What they're saying is, we must make sure that our plans and actions are in harmony with, or correspond to, what our users want or need. In essence, to 'align with' means to position something in a way that matches, supports, or is in agreement with something else.

This phrase is frequently used in product meetings when discussing strategies or plans. For instance, a product manager might say, 'Our product roadmap needs to align with our company's strategic goals.' This implies that the product roadmap - that's our plan for the product's development - should support and reflect the company's overall strategic objectives.

Now, let's imagine a stakeholder update. You might hear, 'The latest feature enhancements align with our customer feedback.' Here, 'align with' communicates that the new features have been developed in response to, and are thus in agreement with, the feedback received from customers.

'Align with' is a versatile phrase, used in both spoken and written communication. It adds a sense of cohesion and unity to your discourse, reflecting the interconnected nature of product management.

If you're looking for alternatives, 'match up with' or 'tally with' can be used in more informal spoken English. 'Corresponds with', however, carries a more formal tone, and is often used in written communication.

Remember, 'align with' is all about harmonisation and agreement. It's a strategic tool in your vocabulary arsenal, helping you articulate how different aspects of a project or plan come together cohesively.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: 'Set something apart from'. 

Imagine you're in a product meeting, discussing how your newest creation is different from others on the market. You would use 'set something apart from' to highlight these unique features. Essentially, it's a phrase that allows us to emphasise what makes something special or superior compared to others. 

For instance, let's say you're planning the launch of a new app. You might explain, 'Our user-friendly interface sets our app apart from others.' This tells everyone that your app's interface is so easy to use, it's a standout feature that separates you from the competition. 

Another example could be when you're in a roadmap discussion. You might state, 'Our commitment to sustainability sets us apart from other businesses.' Here, you're saying your dedication to eco-friendly practices distinguishes you from the rest, aligning with your company's priorities.

Now, as you've probably noticed, this phrase is versatile. It's used in both spoken and written communication, making it a great tool for product discussions, stakeholder updates, and even emails. 

If you're looking for alternatives to 'set something apart from', consider 'distinguish from' or 'differentiate from'. 'Distinguish from' is a bit more formal, making it more suitable for written communication or formal presentations. 'Differentiate from', on the other hand, is more conversational and thus fits well in spoken discussions.

Remember, using these phrases effectively can truly set your communication skills apart from others. Practice them in your daily conversations, and soon they'll become a natural part of your professional vocabulary.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "top performing". Picture this, you?re in a business meeting, and your colleague says: "Our top performing product this quarter is the new AI software." What does this mean? Simply put, "top performing" refers to something that has outperformed all other similar items, often in terms of sales, customer satisfaction, or efficiency. 

In the world of product management, "top performing" is used quite frequently. It's a common way to discuss how well a product or feature is doing compared to others. It's a phrase that helps us prioritise tasks, align with company goals, and make informed decisions. For example, you might hear: "Let's focus our resources on the top performing features in order to drive growth."

Now, let's talk about examples. You're in a product roadmap discussion and you say, "Our top performing product has shown a 20% increase in sales. We should consider this when planning our next quarter." Or, in a stakeholder update, you might say, "We've seen a significant uptick in user engagement with our top performing features, which align with our priorities for customer satisfaction."

"Top performing" can be used in both spoken and written communication. However, it's particularly effective in written reports or presentations where you need to highlight success and drive action. 

Now, let's look at some alternatives to "top performing". You could use "best-selling" when talking about products that have sold the most. This term is often used in sales reports and is more geared towards written English. Another alternative is "most successful", which is a broader term and can be used in both spoken and written English to refer to anything from sales to customer satisfaction. 

Remember, "top performing" is about showcasing success. It's a phrase that communicates efficiency, effectiveness, and triumph in a product or business context.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: outline. 

You might have come across the word "outline" in your day-to-day business communication. In a product management context, "outline" typically refers to providing a broad overview or summary of a particular plan or concept. It's like setting up the scaffolding for a building before adding the details ? it gives everyone a clear picture of what you're aiming for.

For instance, during product meetings, you might hear a colleague say, "Could you outline the main features of the new app for us?" Here, they're asking for a general overview of the app's features, not a deep-dive into every single detail. 

Or, when discussing your product roadmap, you might say, "Let me outline our priorities for the next quarter." That means you'll provide a high-level summary of the key goals and tasks for the upcoming months. 

The word "outline" is versatile and used in both spoken and written communication. It's a fantastic word to leverage when you need to convey complex information in a succinct, understandable way.

Now, if you wish to mix-up your vocabulary a bit, there are a couple of alternatives to "outline". The phrase "give an overview" is a more casual version of outline, often used in spoken English. Another synonym is "summarize", which is similar to outline but is typically more concise and is used more in written communication. Lastly, "sketch out" is a less formal, more creative way of saying outline, and it's used more in brainstorming sessions or casual discussions.

No matter which word you choose, remember that your goal is to provide a clear, succinct summary that helps everyone understand your main points.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: lay out. 

"Lay out" is a versatile phrase that you'll frequently hear in the product management and business world. It's not about arranging your physical workspace, but rather about presenting or explaining something in a clear and understandable manner. For instance, you might "lay out" your plans for a new product feature, or "lay out" your strategy for the next quarter. 

Consider this: your team is brainstorming about a new app feature. You come up with an innovative idea and then you 'lay out' your concept to your team. You are essentially sharing your plan in a structured and detailed manner. 

But let's drill down a bit further. Imagine you?re in a meeting with stakeholders. You might say, "Let me lay out our product roadmap for the next six months", before you proceed to explain your team's direction, priorities, and milestones. This phrase can also be used when you're trying to align everyone's understanding, or when you need to escalate an issue and want to ensure everyone sees the full picture.

"Lay out" is suitable for both spoken and written communication. It's a go-to phrase when you need to present complex information in a way that's easy to understand, whether in a meeting or in an email.

Now, there are a few alternatives to "lay out" that you might find handy. "Present" is one. It's a bit more formal, and more common in written communications. Another is "outline", which is similar to "lay out" but suggests a higher level view, not delving into too much detail. Then there's "detail", which, as you might guess, implies a more in-depth explanation and is typically used in more formal or written contexts. 

So remember, when you need to share your plans, your strategy, or your vision, don't hesitate to 'lay them out' for your colleagues or stakeholders. It's all about clarity, and that's what "lay out" provides.

  <title>Word 76 - Insight On</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: insight on. Now, when we say 'insight on', we're talking about a deep understanding or knowledge about a particular topic or field, particularly in a business or product context. It's a phrase that gets a lot of play in product meetings, roadmap discussions, or stakeholder updates. 

Picture this - you're in a meeting discussing the next product feature. Your boss turns to you and asks, "Do you have any insight on what our competitors are doing in this space?" Essentially, she's asking if you have any valuable knowledge or understanding about the competitor's strategies or products that can help guide your own product development. 

Similarly, if you're working with a team to plan the next quarter?s priorities, and you say, "Based on our customer feedback, I have some insight on the features they want most," you're communicating that you've gathered valuable information from customers that can inform your product roadmap. 

In essence, 'insight on' helps you express that you have a deep, informed understanding about a topic that can contribute to the decision-making process. It's commonly used in both verbal and written communication across the business landscape. 

Now, let's talk alternatives. If 'insight on' feels too formal, you can use 'take' or 'view'. For example, "Here's my take on our competitor's strategy," or "This is my view on the customer's needs." These phrases are more casual and are often used in spoken English. 

On the other hand, if you're writing a formal report or email, you might opt for 'analysis of' or 'perspective on'. For instance, "My analysis of the market trends suggests..." or "From my perspective on customer behaviour...". These alternatives are more formal, carrying a tone of expertise, and often used in written communication.

So, there we have it. 'Insight on' - a phrase that allows you to express your deep understanding of a subject and make a valuable contribution to the product conversation. Use it in meetings, when planning, when discussing decisions, and watch how it enhances your communication.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: surface up. Picture this: You're in a product development meeting, and a colleague says, "We need to surface up the customer pain points." What does this mean? Simply put, to "surface up" means to bring something to attention or make it more visible. The 'something' could be an issue, an idea, a suggestion, or anything that needs to be discussed or addressed.

In the realm of product management, "surface up" is often used in the context of discussions, planning, or decision-making. For example, during a roadmap planning session, you might say, "Let's surface up the features that align with our strategic priorities for the next quarter."

Or consider a stakeholder update meeting. You might hear, "We need to surface up the budget constraints to ensure everyone understands the implications for our product development timeline."

So, you see, "surface up" is a verbal tool used to highlight and draw attention to a particular topic or issue. It's used quite frequently in both verbal and written communication in the business world, especially in emails or reports where it's essential to draw attention to specific points.

But what if you'd like to mix it up a bit? Good news: there are alternatives to "surface up." You could say, "highlight," or "bring to light," both of which carry a similar meaning but might sound a bit more formal. "Flag up" is another alternative that's often used in spoken English within a UK workplace context. Interestingly, it carries a slightly more urgent tone, as if you're raising a red flag about an issue.

So there you have it. To "surface up" is to bring an issue or topic into focus, to make it visible for discussion or action. It's a handy phrase to use in your product management conversations, whether during planning sessions, stakeholder updates, or even day-to-day discussions. Remember, English is a vibrant, evolving language. So don't be afraid to experiment with different phrases and find what works best for you.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "arm someone with something."

In the product management realm, when we say "arm someone with something," we're not talking about wielding weapons. Instead, we're talking about equipping someone with the knowledge, tools, or resources they need to tackle a task or challenge. It's a rather empowering phrase that highlights the importance of being prepared and well-informed.

Let's visualise this with an example from a product meeting. Imagine you're about to present the roadmap for a new software release to your stakeholders. You might say: "I want to arm our stakeholders with a clear understanding of our release timeline and key milestones, so they can align their expectations and priorities accordingly." Here, you're ensuring that your stakeholders are prepared with the necessary information to make informed decisions and support the product's journey.

Or consider a situation in a product planning meeting, where an issue needs escalating. You could say: "Let's arm the engineering team with the customer feedback we've received, so they can address the technical glitches more effectively." In this context, you're equipping the team with valuable insights to solve a problem.

"Arm someone with something" can be used in both spoken and written communication. It's a versatile phrase that brings a sense of proactiveness and readiness to the table.

Now, let's look at a couple of alternatives. One is "equip someone with something", which carries a similar meaning but is slightly more formal. Another is "provide someone with something", which is more neutral and commonly used in both spoken and written English.

Remember, the goal is to communicate effectively, and using phrases like "arm someone with something" will not only enrich your vocabulary but also demonstrate your understanding of the nuances in English communication.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: amplify. This isn't about turning up the volume on your favourite song, though. In product management, to 'amplify' is to make something more visible, impactful, or more significant. It's a word that carries weight, especially when you're discussing strategies and plans to enhance your product's reach or effectiveness.

Consider this phrase: 'We need to amplify our marketing efforts to meet our product launch targets.' In this context, 'amplify' essentially means increasing the intensity or scale of marketing activities to generate more attention or interest in the product. Sounds powerful, doesn't it?

Now, let's turn to a phrase you might hear in a roadmap discussion: 'We aim to amplify the user experience by integrating more intuitive features.' Here, 'amplify' is about enhancing or magnifying the product's user experience, making it more appealing and user-friendly.

Remember, 'amplify' is not just a buzzword. It's a term that gets to the heart of product management, helping us focus on maximising impact. It's commonly used in both spoken and written communication, from casual chats to formal presentations and reports.

Now, if you want to mix things up, there are a few alternatives you can use. 'Enhance' is a good one, with a slightly more formal tone, often used in written documents. Another is 'boost', which is more casual and frequently used in conversation. Both convey the idea of making something better or stronger, just like 'amplify'.

So, the next time you're in a product meeting or drafting an update for stakeholders, don't be afraid to 'amplify' your ideas. It's a powerful word that can make your communication more impactful and persuasive.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: bring something in light. 

This phrase is all about illumination, not of a physical space, but of a concept or situation. When you 'bring something in light', you are revealing new information or adding clarity to a topic. This is a particularly handy phrase in the world of product management, where clear and concise information sharing is key.

For instance, consider this scenario: you're in a product planning meeting, and there's a debate over whether to introduce a new feature. 'Bringing this feature in light' would mean presenting data, user feedback, or any compelling arguments that would help the team make an informed decision. 

Let's use another example. Imagine you're in a stakeholder update, and you want to highlight an issue that's been impacting the product roadmap. You could say, "To bring this issue in light, it's been causing delays in our projected launch." 

So, in both spoken and written communication, 'bring something in light' acts as a linguistic flashlight, guiding your team or stakeholders towards a clearer understanding. 

But, of course, language is a vast ocean and there are other phrases you can use to convey the same idea with slight variations in tone or formality. 'Shed light on something' is a common alternative, slightly more formal, and equally used in spoken or written English. 'Highlight something' is another option, more casual, and often used in spoken English. 'Illuminate something', a bit more formal, is typically seen in written communication. 

Remember, being a successful product manager isn't just about having the best ideas, but also about being able to 'bring those ideas in light', in a way that everyone in the room can understand and align with.

  <title>Word 81 - Labour Intensive</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: labour intensive. 

Imagine you're in a product meeting discussing a new feature for your software. It?s a feature that requires extensive manual work, constant monitoring, and a lot of human effort. In such a scenario, you might describe the process as being 'labour intensive'. In the world of product management, 'labour intensive' refers to tasks or projects that require a high amount of human labour relative to other resources.

Now, let's consider its application in a real-life conversation at work. You might be in a roadmap discussion where you say, "We need to reconsider adding this feature, as it appears to be highly labour intensive and may not align with our priorities." What you're essentially communicating here is that the feature requires a lot of man-hours, which may not be feasible considering your team's bandwidth and company's priorities.

Here?s another scenario. You're in a stakeholder update meeting and you say, "The recent updates are labour intensive to implement, hence, we might need to escalate this issue." In this context, you're indicating that the updates require a lot of effort and time, and it could become a concern that needs to be addressed at a higher level.

While 'labour intensive' is used in both written and spoken communication, it typically emerges in important discussions where you need to convey the level of effort a task requires. 

But remember, language is flexible and it's always good to have alternatives up your sleeve. Instead of 'labour intensive', you could also use 'time-consuming' or 'labour-heavy'. These phrases carry a similar meaning but 'time-consuming' is more commonly used in spoken English, especially in informal conversations. 'Labour-heavy', on the other hand, maintains the formality and is often used in written communication.

So, next time you want to express that a task requires a lot of human effort, remember, it's 'labour intensive'. And, don't shy away from using 'time-consuming' or 'labour-heavy', depending on the context and your audience.

  <title>Word 82 - Prone To Human Errors</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: prone to human errors. Now, this phrase is not rocket science. It simply means that a process or a task is likely to have mistakes due to human involvement. You see, no matter how experienced or skilled we are, we are all human and can make mistakes, especially in complex tasks or under pressure.

In product development, or business in general, you often hear this phrase in discussions about automation, quality control, or risk management. For example, if your team is discussing whether to automate a certain process, someone might say, 'Let's automate this task. It's prone to human errors.' This means the task often has mistakes when done manually and automating it could reduce those mistakes.

Or, in a product planning meeting, you might hear, 'We need a more foolproof design. The current one is prone to human errors.' Here, the phrase is used to highlight the need to make a product or a feature more user-friendly and less likely to lead users into making mistakes. 

To reinforce the meaning, 'prone to human errors' is a phrase used both in spoken and written communication, often to express concerns about the possibility of mistakes and the need for mitigation strategies.

But of course, there's more than one way to express this idea. A good alternative is 'liable to human mistakes'. It's a bit more formal, often used in written documents like reports. Another one is 'subject to human slip-ups'. It's more casual, more common in spoken English, particularly in less formal discussions or brainstorming sessions.

Remember, the goal is not to eliminate all human errors - that's impossible. The goal is to manage and reduce them, to make our products more reliable, user-friendly, and successful in the market.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: count as.

Imagine you're in a strategy meeting, planning your product's upcoming features. You might ask: "Does this feature count as a priority?". In this context, 'count as' simply means to consider or regard something in a particular way. It's a phrase often used when clarifying or validating assumptions, especially during product discussions and planning.

An interesting collocation might be when a team member asks, "Does updating the user interface count as aligning with our priorities?" Here, 'count as' helps ensure everyone is on the same page about what tasks or objectives are deemed crucial.

Now, let's look at a concrete example. Suppose you're in a roadmap discussion. You might say: "I believe optimising our app for speed should count as a critical milestone for Q2." Here, 'count as' is used to express an opinion that a task should be considered essential for a specific timeframe.

The versatility of 'count as' is its strength. It's a phrase equally at home in spoken conversations and written communication, used to drive clarity and shared understanding.

Of course, English is a language of many colours, so let's explore some alternatives. 'Be considered as' is a more formal alternative, often used in written reports. For instance: "The new encryption protocol will be considered as a major security upgrade." On the other hand, 'be seen as', is more casual and frequently used in spoken English. You might say in a team meeting: "This feature could be seen as a game-changer."

Remember, 'count as' is about establishing a shared view about how something is regarded or considered. It's a phrase that comes alive in discussions, where clarity is key, and assumptions need to be tested.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "distinguish something from something".

In the bustling world of product management, we often need to differentiate, or distinguish, one feature, strategy, or product from another. When you distinguish something from something, you're identifying what makes it unique or sets it apart. It's like picking out the red apple in a bowl of green ones. 

Now, let's integrate this into our daily product discussions. You might say, "We need to distinguish our product from the competitors' by focusing on its unique user-friendly design." Or during a roadmap discussion, "Let's distinguish the high-priority tasks from the low-priority ones to align with our quarterly objectives."

In a product meeting, you could use it like this: "Our new feature distinguishes itself from the previous version by its faster load times and intuitive interface." Or in communicating with stakeholders, "We must distinguish the urgent escalations from the minor issues and opt in to receive updates promptly."

The word 'distinguish' is versatile, and you'll find it handy in both written and spoken communication. It's professional, yet accessible, and perfect for making clear comparisons or highlighting unique aspects.

If you want to spice up your language a bit, try using 'differentiate' or 'discriminate between'. These alternatives carry a similar meaning but are often preferred in written communication for their formal tone. On the other hand, 'tell apart' is more casual and commonly used in spoken English.

Remember, being able to 'distinguish something from something' is an essential skill in product management. It allows you to highlight what makes your product or strategy stand out, which is crucial in the competitive UK business landscape.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: testimonials. 

When you think of testimonials, imagine a powerful tool that can help boost your product's credibility and trustworthiness. These are statements from satisfied customers or users that vouch for the quality and effectiveness of your product. In our daily product discussions, we often refer to testimonials when we want to underline the value our product brings to our customers.

In a typical product meeting, you might hear phrases like, 'We've received some glowing testimonials for the new feature we launched last month', or 'Our testimonials align with our priorities to enhance user satisfaction'. 

Let me paint a picture for you. You're in a roadmap discussion, and you're planning the next phase of product development. You might say, 'The positive testimonials indicate that our users find the current design intuitive. It's crucial we maintain this in our next iteration.' Or perhaps you're updating stakeholders on the product's success. You could highlight, 'The influx of testimonials from our users has demonstrated the product's ease of use and the problem it solves for them.'

Testimonials, then, are mainly used in both spoken and written communication. They're a compelling way to showcase your product's value and success.

But let's not forget there are other words we can use in place of 'testimonials'. You might use 'endorsements' or 'accolades'. These terms are a bit more formal and are often used in written communication, such as reports or presentations. Another alternative is 'praise', a less formal word, more commonly used in spoken English. Each of these serves to highlight the positive feedback or recognition your product has received.

Remember, using testimonials effectively can be a game-changer in the world of product management. It not only validates your product but also reinforces the trust your customers have in it.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: in pursuit of. 

As product managers, we're always chasing goals or trying to achieve something, right? That's what 'in pursuit of' means - to be chasing or striving towards a goal or objective. It's a phrase that captures this relentless chase, the continuous journey towards a particular objective.

Now, let's see how this phrase fits into our daily product discussions or decisions. You might hear it used in planning meetings, like 'We are in pursuit of a user-friendly design,' or 'Our team is in pursuit of reducing our app's load time.' It's about aligning with priorities and focusing our energies on targeted outcomes.

Let me illustrate this with a couple of examples. Imagine you're in a product roadmap discussion. You might say, 'In pursuit of enhancing our product's usability, we've decided to invest more in user research.' This clearly communicates your team's goal and the steps you're taking to achieve it.

Or, picture this ? you're giving a stakeholder update. You might say, 'We're in pursuit of a 20% increase in user engagement by Q4.' This not only sets a clear target but also showcases your team's commitment to make it happen.

So, 'in pursuit of' is a versatile phrase used in both spoken and written communication. It helps articulate goals and objectives in a clear, concise manner.

But what if you want to switch it up a bit? Some natural alternatives are 'striving for' or 'seeking to achieve.' These phrases have a similar meaning but might sound a bit more formal. 'Working towards' is another alternative that's commonly used in spoken English, and it's a bit more casual. 

Remember, 'in pursuit of' is about demonstrating dedication and commitment to a goal. It's a powerful phrase to use in your product management conversations, helping you communicate your team's objectives and the steps you're taking to achieve them.

In the world of product management, when we say 'attempt', we're talking about making an effort to achieve something, often something new or challenging. It's about trying, about giving it a go. This word is commonly used in discussions about new product features, market expansions, or strategic shifts.

For instance, you might hear, 'We will attempt to align our product updates with the upcoming marketing campaign.' This implies that your team is going to take on the challenge of coordinating product updates with marketing efforts. 

Or consider this, in a roadmap discussion, a colleague might say, 'Our Q2 attempt to expand into the European market was not as successful as we had hoped.' This communicates that the team made an effort to break into a new market, but the results didn't quite meet expectations.

The word 'attempt' is versatile, used in both spoken and written communication. It's common in everything from impromptu brainstorming sessions to carefully crafted written reports for stakeholders.

So, what are some alternatives to 'attempt'? You could use 'try' or 'endeavour'. 'Try' is less formal, more common in everyday spoken English, and has a similar meaning. 'Endeavour', on the other hand, is a bit more formal, often used in written documents or in formal presentations. It conveys a sense of commitment and determination, perfect for expressing serious efforts on strategic initiatives.

Remember, as a product manager in the UK, when you use 'attempt', you're not just saying you'll do something. You're expressing a commitment to tackling a challenge, to venturing into unknown territories.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: gauge. Now, imagine you're at a meeting, discussing a new product feature. Your team asks, "How can we gauge customer interest in this feature?" Here, 'gauge' is not about measuring car tyre pressure, but an action we often take in business to estimate or assess something.

In the context of product management, 'gauge' is frequently used to convey the process of assessing or estimating a situation, response, or interest. It's like dipping a toe in the water to check the temperature before you decide to swim. We often use it in phrases like "gauge the reaction," to understand how customers or stakeholders might respond to a new product or feature.

Let's look at a real-life example. Suppose you have just released a beta version of your new app. During a team meeting, you might say, "Let's gauge users' feedback to identify potential areas of improvement." By using the word 'gauge', you're referring to the process of assessing responses, which will then inform your product decisions.

'Gauge' is a versatile word, used both in spoken and written communication. It's a handy tool when discussing product strategies, conducting meetings, or writing project updates.

Now, let's look at some alternatives. One option is 'measure'. However, 'measure' often implies a more quantitative approach, while 'gauge' is more about getting a general sense or feel. 'Assess' is another alternative, used more commonly in formal contexts and written communication, while 'gauge' has a more conversational tone, perfect for daily communication.

So, the next time you're in a product meeting or writing an update, remember to 'gauge' the situation before making a decision. It's a simple, yet powerful way to convey that you're taking informed actions based on your keen understanding and assessment.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: primarily. So, what does 'primarily' mean, especially in the context of product management and business? 'Primarily' is often used when we want to highlight the main reason or purpose for something. It's a way of saying 'firstly' or 'most importantly'. 

For instance, in a product development meeting, you might say, 'Our new product is primarily designed to help small businesses streamline their inventory management.' Here, 'primarily' is emphasising that the major goal of this product is to assist small businesses. 

In everyday communication, 'primarily' comes in handy when you're aligning with priorities or escalating an issue. For example, 'The issue needs to be escalated primarily because it severely affects the user experience.' This means that the central reason for escalating the issue is its impact on user experience. 

'Primarily' is a versatile word, used equally in spoken and written communication. Whether you're presenting a product roadmap or sending an email update to stakeholders, 'primarily' helps focus on the main point or purpose.

Now, what if you want to mix things up a little? Some similar words you can use are 'mainly', 'chiefly', and 'essentially'. 'Mainly' is a casual and common alternative, perfect for those informal chats with colleagues. 'Chiefly', on the other hand, has a more formal ring, ideal for written communication or formal presentations. 'Essentially' is somewhere in the middle, a good fit for both spoken and written English. However, remember the nuance ? 'essentially' can sometimes imply that something is inherent or fundamental, not just the first among equals.

So, the next time you're discussing product features or business strategies, remember to use 'primarily' to stress on what's most important. It's a simple yet powerful word that can sharpen your point and make your communication more effective.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "tightly intertwined."

Picture this: You're in a product planning meeting, and your colleague says, "Our marketing strategy and product development are tightly intertwined." What exactly does she mean? 

In essence, when things are tightly intertwined, they're closely connected, often to a point where they influence each other significantly. In the business context, it's used to describe how different aspects of a project, product, or strategy link together. It's a common phrase in product discussions, especially when talking about the relationship between different components - be it the product and market, user experience and design or even between different teams.

Take for example, our own product roadmap and the company's overall strategy. One could say, "Our product roadmap is tightly intertwined with our company's strategic goals." This means that the product decisions we make align with the overall priorities of the company. They're not standalone decisions, but rather, they're carefully considered to meet the broader company goals. 

Or perhaps you've had to escalate an issue to your manager, saying, "The timelines for the software update and client delivery are tightly intertwined. Any delay in the former will adversely impact the latter." Here, you're highlighting the critical interdependence between two processes.

While it?s commonly used in both spoken and written communication, "tightly intertwined" is particularly effective in written updates or reports, as it succinctly conveys the close connection between two or more elements. 

There are also some great alternatives to consider. 'Closely linked' is a natural substitute, often used in less formal or more conversational settings. Another phrase, 'inextricably linked', conveys a similar meaning but with a bit more formality, making it perfect for professional written communication. 

Remember, when you opt to use "tightly intertwined", you're not merely stating that two things are connected. You're emphasising their mutual dependence, the way they seamlessly weave together to form a unified whole.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: incur. When we say "incur" in a business setting, it often refers to experiencing something, usually undesirable, as a result of actions taken. In the product management world, think of it as the costs, risks, or consequences that arise from making certain decisions.

For example, if your team is racing against the clock to launch a new software update, you might hear, ?If we rush the testing phase, we might incur more bugs.? This means that if we hurry the testing process, we might experience more software issues, a consequence we'd rather avoid. 

Another common phrase is "incur costs." For instance, in a roadmap meeting, you might say, "Introducing this new feature will incur additional development costs." Here, you're referring to the extra financial burden the company will have to shoulder to implement this feature. 

In these examples, you can see that 'incur' is often paired with words like 'risk', 'cost', or 'loss'. We use it to highlight potential negative outcomes that could arise from our decisions.

'Incur' is versatile, used in both spoken and written communication. It's a handy word to have in your vocabulary, particularly when discussing project risks or financial implications.

Now, you might ask, "What are some alternatives?" Good question. Instead of 'incur', you could use 'sustain'. For example, you might say, "We don't want to sustain any reputational damage." However, 'sustain' is a bit more formal, and usually used in written communication.

Another alternative is 'experience'. You can say, "We don't want to experience delays in our launch." 'Experience' is a more neutral option and can be used in both spoken and written English.

Remember, 'incur' is a powerful word. It helps you articulate potential downsides in a concise and professional way, showing your understanding of the implications of business decisions.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: enlarge. Picture this, you're in a product planning meeting, and your team leader says, "We need to enlarge our user base in the next quarter." What exactly does she mean? In this context, 'enlarge' means to increase or make bigger. In the world of product management, 'enlarge' frequently refers to expanding scopes, whether it's users, markets, or even the functionality of the product itself.

Now, how do we use 'enlarge' in daily communication? Let's say you're discussing a product update, and you might say, "If we enlarge our feature set, we can meet more customer needs." That's one of the common ways we use 'enlarge' in product discussions ? to communicate the idea of growth or expansion. 

Want a real-life example? Imagine you're in a roadmap discussion and you say, "Our plan is to enlarge our product offering to include home automation features." Here, 'enlarge' conveys the expansion of your product?s capabilities. 

Remember, 'enlarge' is a versatile word used in both spoken and written communication. It?s professional, clear, and universally understood in business settings.

Now, what if you want to shake things up a bit? There are a few alternatives to 'enlarge'. One of them is 'expand'. It's less formal and more commonly used in spoken English. Another alternative is 'augment', which is more formal and often used in written documents, especially in technical or detailed product specifications.

So, the next time you're in a product meeting or writing a stakeholder update, remember 'enlarge'. It's all about making things bigger, expanding our horizons, and growing our opportunities.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: prohibit.

In the world of product management, 'prohibit' often pops up during discussions on product design or deployment. It means to formally forbid something by law, rule, or other authority. In the context of our profession, it could relate to constraints that prevent us from taking certain actions.

For example, let's say you're in a product meeting discussing how to roll out a new feature. You might say, "Our privacy policy prohibits us from sharing customer data without explicit consent." This means the policy is preventing or forbidding the sharing of data.

Another instance might be during a roadmap discussion, where you're planning out the stages of product development. You might say, "Budget limitations prohibit us from launching all the desired features at once." Here, the budget constraints are preventing the simultaneous launch of all features.

'Prohibit' is used in both spoken and written communication, often to convey serious restrictions. It's a powerful word that lets everyone know certain actions are off-the-table.

As for alternatives, you could use words like 'forbid', 'prevent', or 'restrict'. 'Forbid' is pretty formal and gives a strong sense of authority, often used in written rules and regulations. 'Prevent,' on the other hand, is a bit softer and more common in spoken English. It's perfect when you're talking about things that stop an action from happening without an authoritative tone. 'Restrict' is somewhere in between, used in both speech and writing and carries a sense of limitation.

Remember, 'prohibit' and its alternatives are all about establishing boundaries and ensuring alignment with priorities, legal regulations, or company policies. Using these words confidently will show your colleagues and stakeholders that you understand the bigger picture and are considerate of the constraints in place.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: 'exam something'. This phrase is often used in British business environments, and it's especially relevant for those of us in product management.

Examining something isn't about holding a physical product up to the light, rather it's a metaphorical process of detailed analysis and review. When you 'exam something', you scrutinize it closely, you dissect its components, you delve into its mechanisms to understand how it works, why it works, or where it can be improved. 

In product discussions, this phrase is typically used to refer to the thorough investigation of a product's performance, its market fit, or its user feedback. For example, during a roadmap discussion, you might say, 'We need to exam our user engagement metrics to align with the upcoming Q2 priorities.' Or in a product meeting, you might suggest, 'Let's exam the latest user feedback to identify areas for improvement.'

This phrase is versatile and can be used both in spoken and written communication. It's a great way to convey your intention to look into something meticulously, making it perfect for stakeholder updates, project planning, and product decisions.

Now, let's look at some alternatives. You could say 'scrutinize' or 'analyse'. Both of these words carry a similar meaning as 'exam', but with slight nuances. 'Scrutinize' suggests a more detailed, perhaps even critical examination, and is often used in formal written communication. 'Analyse', on the other hand, is a bit more neutral and commonly used in both spoken and written English. It simply means to examine something methodically, breaking it down into smaller parts for better understanding.

Remember, the key to using 'exam something' effectively is to convey your intent to understand a product, a situation, or a process better by taking a close, detailed look at it. It's about being thorough, being curious, and being proactive in identifying areas of improvement or potential pitfalls.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: outpace. 

In the dynamic realm of product management, 'outpace' is a word you'll hear quite frequently. It's about running faster, but not in a literal sense. When we say a product or a company is 'outpacing' another, we're talking about it growing, innovating, or improving at a quicker rate than its competitors. It's a term that signifies progress and a competitive edge. 

Picture yourself in a meeting discussing your product roadmap. You might say, 'Our latest features have outpaced those of our main competitors, giving us a strong position in the market.' Here, 'outpace' underscores your product's superiority and shows that your team is ahead of the curve.

A common phrase you might hear is, 'We need to outpace market trends.' In this context, 'outpace' means staying ahead of customer expectations and industry shifts. It's about setting the pace, not just keeping up. 

Now, let's not forget about written communication. 'Outpace' is often used in business reports and emails. For example, in a stakeholder update, you might write, 'Our delivery timeline is set to outpace projected estimates.' This tells your stakeholders that you're not just meeting targets, but exceeding them. 

To sum up, 'outpace' is a versatile word that can add power to both your spoken and written communication. It's about competition, progress, and staying ahead. 

If you're looking for alternatives, consider 'surpass' or 'exceed.' Both carry a similar meaning but have a slightly more formal tone. 'Surpass' is commonly used in written English, while 'exceed' can be used in both spoken and written contexts. 

Remember, in the fast-paced world of product management, it's not just about keeping up, it's about outpacing.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. We're here to help you shine in your product manager role with a word that's essential in any product discussion: "lag in". Now, let's get into it!

When we say something is "lagging in", we mean it's not keeping pace, it's falling behind. You might see this in a product context when a feature or project isn?t progressing as fast as it should be. It's often used in daily communication, especially when discussing product timelines or the progress of a specific task.

Let's walk through a couple of examples. Imagine you're in a product meeting, and you're discussing an app you're developing. You might say, "The UX design is lagging in comparison to the coding progress,? indicating that the design aspect is not keeping up with the coding aspect. 

Or, in a roadmap discussion with stakeholders, you might report, "Our product is lagging in the market against our competitors due to delayed feature rollouts.? This shows that your product is falling behind in the market competition because of certain delays. 

So, the phrase "lag in" is a handy way to express that something is not keeping up or is falling behind, whether in spoken or written communication. But remember, it's not the only way to say this. You could also say, "falling behind" when speaking with colleagues, or "not keeping pace with" when writing a more formal report. Each of these alternatives has a similar meaning, but their nuances and usage depend on the situation and the formality of your communication.

So there you have it! You're now equipped to use the phrase "lag in" effectively in your product discussions, meetings, or reports. Remember, it's about expressing that something isn't keeping up or is falling behind in a certain context.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: data breaches.

Data breaches occur when unauthorised individuals gain access to secure, confidential information. In our world of product management, this could mean anything from leaked customer data to confidential product designs. It's a term we often discuss when it comes to data security and product protection.

You might hear phrases like, "We need to prevent potential data breaches" during product planning meetings, or "Our priority is to address the recent data breach" in a crisis management situation. It's important to keep in mind that data breaches are not just an IT issue, but a product management concern as well, as they can impact our product's reputation and user trust.

Let's look at a couple of realistic examples. Imagine you're in a roadmap discussion and you bring up a point about data security. You might say, "To mitigate data breaches, we need to align our next product update with enhanced security measures." Or perhaps in a stakeholder update, you have to deliver some unfortunate news. You might say, "We've identified a data breach and have already escalated the issue to our security team."

Data breaches, as a term, is used in both written and spoken communication. It carries a formal tone due to its serious implications and is commonly used in business environments, especially those dealing with data-rich products.

Some natural alternatives for 'data breaches' could be 'data leaks' or 'security infringements'. 'Data leaks' has a similar tone and is used equally in spoken and written English, but it usually refers to data escaping unintentionally. 'Security infringements', on the other hand, is slightly more formal and is often used in legal or official documents. 

Remember, the key is to understand the context and use the term appropriately. This not only shows your grasp of the language but also demonstrates your understanding of the importance of data security in product management.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: data leaks.

In the pulse of our digital era, the term 'data leaks' has become increasingly prominent. If you're picturing a dripping faucet, you're not far off. In a business context, 'data leaks' refer to sensitive information slipping out of an organization, often unintentionally, into the public realm or, even worse, into the hands of competitors. 

Just imagine you're in a product meeting and someone says, "We need to address potential data leaks before rolling out the new feature." This means, they want to ensure the security of user information before launching any new aspects to the product. 

In another scenario, you might be roped into a roadmap discussion where the phrase "Let's align our priorities to prevent possible data leaks" crops up. Here, the team is emphasizing the importance of safeguarding information as a major part of their strategic planning. 

Data leaks is a term used equally in spoken and written communication, whether it's during office chats or in lengthy email threads. It's a term that's come to the forefront due to the increasing importance of data protection laws and the impact of leaks on a company's reputation. 

Let's see some alternatives. You might hear 'data breach', which is more formal and often used when an outsider has intentionally accessed the data. 'Data exposure' is another term, which is typically used when sensitive information is unintentionally left unprotected and accessible to others. 

Remember, in the digital world of product management, 'data leaks', 'data breaches', or 'data exposures' are all phrases you'll encounter regularly. They underline the significance of securing our users' data and the potential risks if we fail to do so.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "shred something". Now, when you think of "shred", you might imagine tearing up paper into tiny pieces. But in a business context, especially in product management, to "shred something" often means to dissect or analyse it thoroughly. It's like tearing apart an idea or a plan to examine its every detail. 

This term is regularly used in product discussions when teams need to critically evaluate a product's features, or assess a competitor's strategy. It's about breaking it down to understand it better. For instance, in a product meeting, you might hear, "Let's shred our roadmap to ensure it aligns with our priorities". This means the team is going to scrutinize every detail of the roadmap to ensure it fits with the company's objectives.

Another example would be during a stakeholder update, where the team could say, "We've shredded the latest user feedback, and it suggests we need to focus more on improving our app's user interface". Here, the team has examined the feedback closely to draw meaningful conclusions.

So, the term "shred something" can be used in both spoken and written communication, although it's more common in spoken English during meetings or discussions. 

Now, a couple of alternatives for "shred something" could be "break down" or "analyse in detail". "Break down" is a more casual phrase, often used in spoken English. It has a similar tone to "shred something", but is perhaps a bit softer. "Analyse in detail", on the other hand, is more formal and is commonly used in written communication, such as reports or emails.

Remember, when you "shred something", you're not destroying it, but rather, you're taking a closer, more detailed look to understand it better. So, the next time you're in a product discussion or planning session, don't hesitate to suggest a good "shred" of the topic at hand. You'll sound confident, decisive and very much in tune with the UK business communication style.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: minimize something. Picture this: you're in a product-planning meeting, and the team is discussing ways to reduce costs, cut down on time or decrease potential risks. That's where 'minimize' comes into play. It's a word that means to reduce something, especially something undesirable, to the smallest possible amount or degree. 

In the realm of product management, 'minimize' is often used in sentences like, 'We need to minimize the production costs' or 'Let's minimize the risks associated with this new feature.' It?s a word that's used frequently in both written and spoken communication, especially when you're making product decisions or communicating with stakeholders. 

Now, let's put it in context with a couple of examples. Imagine you're in a roadmap discussion and you say, 'In the next quarter, we aim to minimize user churn by improving our onboarding experience.' Or perhaps you're giving a stakeholder update and you state, 'We've been able to minimize delays in the project by adopting agile methodologies.'

Revisiting the meaning, 'minimize something' is about reducing or lessening something to its lowest possible level. It's a versatile word used in both spoken and written English, particularly within the context of product and business discussions.

Now, let's look at a few alternatives to the word 'minimize'. One such word is 'mitigate'. When you say, 'We need to mitigate the risks', you're expressing the need to make them less severe or harmful. Mitigate is slightly more formal and typically found more in written communication. Another alternative is 'reduce'. It's a straightforward, commonly used term in both spoken and written English, but it may lack the specificity of 'minimize' in certain contexts. 

So, there you have it. 'Minimize' is your go-to term when you're looking to convey the reduction of something undesirable in the most efficient way possible. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!"</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: remediate. 

When we say 'remediate' in a business context, we're talking about identifying and resolving problems or shortcomings. In the world of product management, it's the process of improving a product or addressing issues to ensure it meets the needs of the customers and stakeholders. You'll often hear it in product discussions, planning, or decision-making sessions.

In daily communication, we might say something like, "We need to remediate the issue with the app's loading time." This means we've identified a problem with the app's performance, and we're making plans to solve it.

Let?s consider a practical example. In a product meeting, you might hear, "Our user feedback indicates a problem with the checkout process. We need to remediate this to align with our customer satisfaction priorities." This points to an area of the product that needs improvement. 

In another scenario, during a roadmap discussion, the statement might be, "As we escalate this issue, let?s remediate our approach to data security in the next quarter." This means the team plans to improve and enhance their data security measures.

Remediate is a versatile word used in both spoken and written communication. It?s a more formal alternative to words like 'fix' or 'resolve'. Another synonym could be 'rectify', although 'remediate' is more common in a product management context, indicating a systematic approach to problem-solving.

Remember, using 'remediate' shows your commitment to improvement and your ability to proactively address and solve issues, crucial traits of a successful product manager.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: await.

You know that feeling when you're on the edge of your seat, anticipating something? That's exactly what 'await' encapsulates. It's a verb we use when we're expecting something to happen or arrive. In the world of product management, it could be a decision, a report, or even the launch of a new product.

Imagine you've just completed a product planning meeting and you're waiting for the final approval from your stakeholders. You might say, 'We await the stakeholders' decision on our product roadmap.' A common phrase we hear a lot is 'await feedback', especially after presenting new ideas or proposals. 

Let's bring this to life. You're in a meeting and your colleague says, 'The design team is finalising the prototype. We're awaiting their completion before we can proceed with user testing.' Or maybe you're giving an update to your team: 'Our Q3 goals are aligned with the priorities we set, and we're now awaiting the sales forecast to finalise the budget.'

As you can see, 'await' is commonly used in both spoken and written communication, but it's particularly handy when you want to sound more formal in emails or written reports. 

Now, you might be wondering, 'Suzy, are there other words I can use instead of await?' Absolutely. 'Wait for' is a more casual alternative you could use in spoken communication, like 'We're waiting for the client's response.' If you want to keep the formality, consider 'anticipate' or 'expect', as in 'We anticipate the market analysis report next week.' Just remember, each word carries its own nuance and formality, so choose the one that best fits your context.

That's it for today! Remember, 'await' is your go-to word when you're expecting something in your product journey. Use it confidently, and add a touch of formality to your business communication. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!"</podcast:transcript>

  <title>Word 103 - Marginal Damage</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: marginal damage. 

Imagine you're the product manager of a tech company. You're working on the latest software update and there's a small glitch that's causing a tiny bit of inconvenience to some users. This, my friends, is what we call 'marginal damage'. It?s that minor harm or loss which might not seem like a big deal, but can potentially impact the overall user experience or the product's reputation. 

In the realm of product management, you often hear phrases like, "We need to assess the marginal damage of this bug," or "Let's escalate this issue to mitigate the marginal damage." It's a term that pops up during roadmap discussions, product meetings, or stakeholder updates, helping us convey the smaller, yet significant, issues that need attention.

For instance, let's say you're in a meeting discussing the launch of a new mobile app feature. You might say, "The beta testing showed some marginal damage, as users found the new interface a bit confusing. We need to align this with our priorities and address it before the full-scale rollout." That's marginal damage in action, highlighting a realistic, tangible problem in the product development cycle.

While marginal damage can be used in both spoken and written communication, it's predominantly seen in written reports or emails, as it helps product managers articulate minor issues with clarity and precision.

Now, you might be wondering, are there any alternatives to this term? Absolutely. You could use 'minimal harm' or 'slight damage'. These phrases carry the same essence but are slightly less formal and more commonly used in spoken English. 'Insignificant impact' is another alternative, but it's a tad more formal and more suited for written communication, especially when addressing senior stakeholders.

Remember, marginal damage isn?t about major catastrophes. It?s about those smaller issues that, when ignored, can snowball into something bigger. So, keep an ear out for it in your next product meeting or stakeholder update.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: supplemental. 

You might have come across 'supplemental' in your product management journey, but let's delve deeper into how it can be used effectively. 'Supplemental' means something that is added to something else to enhance or complete it. In the realm of product management, it often refers to additional resources, data, or features that support the main product or task at hand.

For instance, let's say you're planning a new release. During a product meeting, you might hear, 'We'll need supplemental resources to ensure a smooth rollout.' This implies seeking extra help, perhaps in the form of additional staff or technology, to complement the existing team and tools.

It's also common to discuss 'supplemental information' during roadmap discussions. If you're presenting to stakeholders, you might say, 'Here is the projected timeline for our next product update, along with some supplemental data on anticipated user trends.' This means you're providing extra details, beyond the primary information, to give a more comprehensive picture.

So, 'supplemental' is a handy term to use in both spoken and written communication in the business world, especially when you're dealing with additional elements that enhance the main subject.

If you're looking for alternatives to 'supplemental', you might consider 'complementary' or 'auxiliary'. 'Complementary' is more casual and is often used in conversational English to mean something that completes or goes well with something else. 'Auxiliary', on the other hand, is a bit more formal and usually refers to secondary or support elements, particularly in written English.

So next time you're in a product meeting or drafting an email, remember 'supplemental'. It's a useful term to express the idea of added value or support, whether you're talking about resources, features, or data.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: compromise. 

Picture this: You're in a meeting, the developers and the marketing team have differing views on the functionality and design of your latest product. You're in the middle, as the Product Manager, trying to find a middle ground. That's when you'll need to employ the art of 'compromise'. 

In product management, 'compromise' is an essential skill. It's about finding a balanced solution where each party involved may have to give up something, but the end result aligns with the company?s priorities and the product's success. It?s often used in daily communication, particularly when discussing product features, planning timelines, or making tough decisions.

For instance, let's say the developers want to spend more time perfecting the product, but marketing is pushing for an early launch to capitalise on a market trend. As a Product Manager, you might suggest a 'compromise' - launching a minimum viable product first, then iterating on it. This allows marketing to leverage the trend, while giving developers more time to refine the product. 

Another realistic scenario could be a stakeholder who wants to include a feature that, while innovative, would blow out the budget. Here, your 'compromise' might be proposing a more cost-effective alternative that doesn't compromise the product's overall value. 

The word 'compromise' is widely used in both spoken and written communication. However, it's particularly common in spoken discussions, where quick, effective solutions are required.

If you're looking for alternatives to 'compromise', consider 'meet halfway' or 'find a middle ground'. These phrases carry a similar meaning, but with a more casual tone, making them perfect for less formal, spoken discussions. On the other hand, 'reconcile differences' is a bit more formal and typically used in written communication, like in meeting minutes or email updates. 

Remember, as a Product Manager, mastering the art of 'compromise' is key to navigating different views, aligning priorities, and driving your product towards success.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: pose as. Now, you might be imagining someone in a disguise, pretending to be someone else. And you're not entirely wrong. In the business context, 'pose as' is a phrase used to describe a situation where something is presented or appears as something else. It's often used when discussing challenges or opportunities in product development and strategy.

Imagine you're in a product meeting and your team is discussing a new feature. You might say, 'This feature could pose as a unique selling point for our product.' This means the feature has the potential to be seen or presented as a unique selling point.

Another example could be during a stakeholder update. Perhaps you've identified a potential issue that might not seem like a big deal at first glance but could potentially escalate. You might say, 'This small glitch could pose as a major problem down the line if we don't address it now.' 

So when you're discussing potential opportunities or threats in your product roadmap, 'pose as' is a handy phrase to express that something might appear or act as something else in the future. It's used in both spoken and written communication, so it's equally at home in your presentations, emails or in casual conversation.

Now, you could also use alternatives like 'serve as' or 'act as'. For example, 'This feature could serve as a unique selling point.' or 'This glitch could act as a major problem.' Both alternatives carry a similar meaning but with a slightly different tone. 'Serve as' is often used when something fulfils a role or function, while 'act as' implies that something is temporary or not its original function. Both are commonly used in spoken and written English.

So, remember, when you're discussing potential opportunities or threats in your product roadmap, don't hesitate to use 'pose as', 'serve as' or 'act as' to make your points clear and persuasive.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is: set aside something. 

In the realm of product management, 'set aside something' brings to mind the idea of reserving resources or rescheduling tasks for a specific purpose. It's about creating a space or time for something important, either physically or metaphorically.

In daily communication, especially in product planning or decisions, we often use 'set aside something' to discuss priorities. For instance, we might say, 'We need to set aside some budget for user testing' or 'Let's set aside time next week to review the roadmap'. It helps us align our resources and time with our priorities.

Imagine you're in a product meeting, and the team is excited about a new feature. But you realise it could escalate costs significantly. You might say, 'While the feature is innovative, we need to set aside additional budget to implement it. Let's consider the implications before we opt in.'

Or perhaps during a stakeholder update, you might say, 'We've set aside some time to address your concerns about the product?s launch date. Let's talk about how we can realign our timeline to meet the market demands.' 

So, 'set aside something' is a versatile phrase, used in both verbal and written communication. It allows us to create space for important things, whether it's money, time, or even mental bandwidth. 

Now, you might wonder, are there other ways to say 'set aside something'? Of course! You could say 'allocate resources for' or 'reserve time for'. These phrases are a bit more formal and are often found in written documents or formal meetings. Another less formal alternative is 'make room for', which is typically used in spoken English.

So, there you have it. 'Set aside something' - a simple yet powerful phrase that can help you effectively communicate priorities and resource allocation in your product management journey.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: pillars. No, not the architectural kind, but the ones that hold up and shape the structure of our business strategies, especially in product management. They're the essential principles or values that a strategy is built around.

In the context of product planning and decision-making, pillars represent the core areas we focus on. They're the fundamental components that uphold our product vision and roadmap. You might often hear phrases like 'These are the four pillars of our product strategy,' or 'We need to revisit our performance pillars.'

Let's imagine we're in a product meeting discussing the new software we're developing. We've identified 'user experience,' 'security,' 'scalability,' and 'sustainability' as the pillars of our product. These are the areas we'll be investing in, and they'll guide our decision-making process. In another scenario, when giving a stakeholder update, you could say, 'Our product aligns with the company's pillars of innovation, customer centricity, and sustainability.'

So, pillars are used frequently in both spoken and written communication. They're not just business jargon; they provide a clear, focused framework for everyone to understand and work towards.

Now, if you want to sprinkle your conversation with some synonyms, 'cornerstones,' 'foundations,' and 'bedrocks' are all natural alternatives with similar connotations. 'Cornerstones' is often heard in spoken English and is less formal, while 'foundations' and 'bedrocks' are more formal and commonly used in written communication.

Remember, pillars are more than just a word. They encapsulate the essence of your product or business strategy, giving direction and clarity. It's a term that is integral to the product management landscape in the UK, and indeed, across the globe.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: bucket. 

Now, I'm not talking about the garden tool we fill with water or sand. In the world of product management, 'bucket' refers to a group or category where we place related items, tasks, or ideas. It's a way to organise and prioritise what we're working on. In daily communication, you would hear phrases like 'put it in the development bucket' or 'it falls into the marketing bucket'. 

Let's dive into an example. Imagine you're in a product meeting, discussing a new feature for your app. One of your colleagues says, 'Let's bucket this feature into Q3 for development but start user testing in Q2.' Now, what your colleague is doing here is categorising tasks based on their priority and timeline. 

Another instance could be during a stakeholder update. You might say, 'We've bucketed the customer feedback into three categories: user interface, functionality, and support.' You're grouping similar types of feedback together to make it easier to address.

So, 'bucket' can be used in both spoken and written communication, and it's a great word to add to your product management vocabulary. 

If you're looking for alternatives, 'group' or 'categorise' can be used in a similar way. 'Group' is less formal, perfect for a quick chat with colleagues. 'Categorise' is a bit more formal and is great for presentations or written reports. 

Another informal alternative is 'bundle'. You might say, 'Let's bundle these tasks together.' It's commonly used in spoken English, especially in informal settings like team discussions.

Remember, no matter what word you use, the goal is to organise tasks or ideas in a way that aligns with your priorities.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: overlooked. Picture this - you're in a product discussion, and your team is evaluating the performance of the latest launch. Suddenly, your colleague says, "I think we've overlooked the user feedback on our mobile interface." What does he mean by 'overlooked'? Simply put, to 'overlook' is to unintentionally fail to notice or consider something important. 

In the world of product management, the term 'overlooked' is often used to highlight an issue or a factor that wasn't given due consideration. It could be a detail in a user survey, a crucial step in a project plan, or a key stakeholder update. You see, in our busy work environments, it's quite possible to overlook certain elements, especially when you're juggling multiple tasks at once. 

Let's consider an example. In a roadmap discussion, your team might be focused on the development of a new feature. However, you notice that the potential impact on the existing user experience hasn't been thoroughly discussed. Here, you could say, "I believe we might have overlooked the possible effects on our current users." 

Another realistic situation could be during a stakeholder update. You might have to say, "Apologies, we overlooked including the marketing costs in our initial budget estimate. We will rectify this oversight immediately."

Despite its negative connotation, 'overlooked' is a commonly used term in both spoken and written communication within the business context. It's a clear and straightforward way of acknowledging that something was missed, but can be corrected moving forward. 

If you want to vary your language, consider using 'neglected' or 'missed out'. 'Neglected' carries a slightly stronger tone, implying that something was not just overlooked but ignored, while 'missed out' is a more informal phrase typically used in spoken communication. 

Remember, everyone overlooks details occasionally. The important part is to address these oversights and learn from them. That's how we grow as professionals in the product management world.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: upmarket.

When we refer to something as 'upmarket', we're essentially saying it's high-end, top-notch, or premium. It's a term often thrown around in product discussions to describe products or services that are of superior quality or sophistication, generally appealing to customers with a larger disposable income or more discerning tastes.

Imagine being in a meeting and your team is brainstorming ways to cater for a new demographic. You might suggest, 'How about we develop an upmarket version of our product to attract more affluent consumers?' Or perhaps during a roadmap discussion, you might find yourself saying, 'Our next step should be moving upmarket to differentiate ourselves from the competition.'

This kind of language helps align our product development strategies with the priorities of attracting a more high-end clientele or adding a touch of luxury to our offerings. It's a way of communicating a shift in focus, an upgrade, or a sophisticated twist in our business approach.

Now, you might be wondering, is 'upmarket' more of a spoken term or is it used in written communication too? Well, it's both. You can use it in casual conversation, in meetings, and it also fits perfectly well in written reports or emails.

Now, you might not always want to use 'upmarket'. Some alternatives could be 'premium', 'high-end', or 'luxury'. These words carry the same general meaning but add a little variety to your language. 'Premium' and 'high-end' are more neutral, suitable for both formal and informal contexts, while 'luxury' can add a touch of extravagance to your communication.

So, next time you're involved in a product discussion or planning a new strategy, remember the term 'upmarket'. It's a powerful way to communicate your product?s elevated status, appealing to a sophisticated and discerning market.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: assertion. You've probably heard this term in meetings or read it in emails, but what does it actually mean in the context of product management?

Picture this: you're in a product planning meeting, and you make a confident statement based on facts or beliefs. That's an assertion. It's a strong declaration, often used when you're sure of your facts and you're ready to stand by them. For example, you might say, 'My assertion is that the new feature will increase user engagement by 20 percent.' It?s a powerful tool in product discussions, helping to convey confidence and certainty.

A common phrase that comes up with 'assertion' is 'to make an assertion.' It means you're about to present your strong belief or fact, just like in our example. Another typical scenario might be during a roadmap discussion. You might say, 'Based on our user research, my assertion is that we need to prioritize the chat function upgrade in Q2.' 

Just remember, an assertion isn?t a wild guess; it's based on evidence and often used to back up a strategic decision or direction. And it?s equally at home in both spoken and written communication, making it a versatile word in your vocabulary arsenal.

Looking for alternatives to 'assertion'? Try 'claim' or 'declaration.' 'Claim' tends to be a bit less formal and is often used when the evidence might be less concrete. 'Declaration,' on the other hand, carries a level of formality and is typically used in more official or written contexts.

So, next time you're in a meeting or penning an email, don't shy away from making an assertion. It?s a powerful way to communicate your certainty and help drive product decisions. Remember, your words have power; use them wisely.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: due diligence. 

In the business world, particularly in product management, 'due diligence' is a term we use often. It's not just legal jargon, it's our way of saying, 'doing our homework' on a project or decision. If you're doing your due diligence, you're thoroughly researching, evaluating, and understanding all aspects before making a decision or a commitment. 

In daily communication, you might hear someone say, 'We need to do our due diligence before launching this new feature.' This could mean analysing data, reviewing customer feedback, or consulting with various stakeholders to ensure the feature aligns with our priorities and goals.

Imagine you?re in a product planning meeting, and a team member suggests integrating a new technology into your app. Before diving head-first into implementation, you might say, 'Let's do our due diligence first, and research how this technology has been received in other applications.' 

Or perhaps you're in a roadmap discussion, and you're asked to update stakeholders on the progress of a new product. You might say, 'In our due diligence, we discovered a potential issue with our supply chain, but we're investigating solutions.' 

In essence, due diligence is a proactive process of gathering and analysing information to make informed, responsible decisions. And while it's a phrase we often use in spoken communication, it's also frequent in written communication, like in emails or reports.

Now, if you're looking for alternatives, there are a few. 'Doing our homework' or 'doing a deep dive' convey similar ideas in a more casual, conversational tone, typically used in spoken English. For a more formal alternative, particularly in written communication, you might use 'comprehensive evaluation' or 'thorough investigation'. 

Remember, due diligence isn't just a fancy term?it's a fundamental part of being a responsible and effective product manager.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: pertain. 

Now, when we say something 'pertains to' something else, we mean it's related or relevant to that topic. Picture yourself in a product planning meeting. You are discussing features that pertain to user experience, meaning those features that directly influence how users interact with your product. 

In a business context, especially in product management, we often use 'pertain' when we talk about tasks, responsibilities, or issues that are directly linked to our roles or projects. For instance, in a team meeting, your manager might say, "Let's focus on issues that pertain to our upcoming release." This means focusing on issues that are directly connected to, or have a significant impact on, the upcoming product release. 

Imagine you're presenting a project update to stakeholders. You might say, "These statistics pertain to our user growth since the last update." Here, 'pertain' helps you clarify that the data you're sharing is relevant to the specific topic of user growth. 

So, 'pertain' is a versatile word that can be used both in spoken and written communication to establish relevance or connection. 

But, we don't always have to use 'pertain'. Some natural alternatives include 'relate to' or 'correspond with'. 'Relate to' is a less formal way of saying 'pertain to' and is commonly used in spoken English. 'Correspond with', on the other hand, has a more formal tone and is often seen in written documents, especially those that require a higher level of formality like reports or formal emails.

Remember, 'pertain' is a small but powerful word that can help you clearly express connections and relevance in your product discussions and decisions.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: spot. 

Imagine you're in a product brainstorming meeting and someone says, "We need to spot the gaps in our current roadmap." Here, 'spot' means to identify or discover. It's commonly used in daily communication, particularly in product discussions or decisions. You might hear phrases like 'spot a trend', where you identify a pattern or tendency, or 'spot a problem', referring to noticing an issue that needs solving.

Now, let's delve into some real-life examples. Picture this: You're in a meeting discussing the product's performance. Your colleague might say, 'We've spotted an increase in user engagement since the last update.' Here, they've noticed an improvement, thanks to careful observation and analysis.

In another scenario, suppose you're providing a stakeholder update. You might say, 'We need to spot any potential risks in the upcoming product launch.' In this context, you're emphasising the need to identify any possible pitfalls or drawbacks before they occur.

'Spot' is a verb that's equally useful in both spoken and written communication. It's a straightforward and effective way to express the act of noticing or identifying something.

Now, if you want to mix things up a bit, there are a few natural alternatives you can use. 'Detect' and 'identify' are two such words. 'Detect' often implies a more systematic or thorough process of discovery, and it's more commonly used in written communication, particularly in formal reports. 'Identify', on the other hand, is a more neutral term, used widely in both spoken and written English, and it signifies recognition or acknowledgment of something.

Remember, mastering these words and their nuances will allow you to communicate with clarity and precision, a key skill in the dynamic world of product management.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: evident. 

Imagine you're in the midst of a product meeting, discussing the latest user feedback. You might say, "It?s evident from the feedback that our new features are a hit." What does "evident" mean here? In simple terms, when something is 'evident', it is clear or obvious, especially from facts or observations. It's a handy word to use when you want to show that the data or information you're discussing is not just an opinion or guess but is based on solid evidence.

In the world of product management, we often use this word when talking about trends or results. For instance, you might say, "The success of our latest product launch is evident in the sales figures," or during a roadmap discussion, "It's evident that we need to align our next release with market trends." 

"Evident" is a versatile word, useful in both spoken and written communication. So whether you're giving a presentation or writing an email, it can help you sound confident and precise.

Now, let's look at some alternatives for "evident". You could use "apparent" or "obvious", both conveying the same meaning. However, "apparent" sounds a bit more formal, and is usually used in written communication, while "obvious" has a more casual tone, making it a good choice for spoken communication.

Another handy synonym is "clear". It's neutral in terms of formality and can be used in both spoken and written English. For instance, in a stakeholder update, you might say, "It's clear from our user engagement metrics that the new interface is well-received."

So, there you have it. 'Evident' - a straightforward word that can help you communicate clearly and confidently in product discussions, planning, or decisions. Remember, the key is to use it when you want to point out something that is clear or obvious from facts or observations.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: intended.

Imagine you're in a product planning meeting, and your colleague says, 'Our intended user base for this feature is young professionals.' What they're saying is, they've designed the feature specifically for young professionals. 'Intended' here describes a planned or desired outcome, typically one that's been thoughtfully designed or purposefully chosen. 

In the context of product management, we often use 'intended' during planning, strategy discussions, or even when communicating with stakeholders. It helps convey our strategic goals or targets, be it in terms of audience, functionality, or results.

For instance, you might hear, 'The intended benefit of this update is to improve user experience.' Or in a roadmap discussion, 'The feature is intended to align with our Q4 priorities.'

'Intended' is commonly used in both spoken and written communication, making it a versatile word in your English vocabulary toolkit. 

If you're looking for some alternatives, 'planned' or 'designed' can be used interchangeably. However, 'planned' often implies a more strategic or long-term perspective, whereas 'designed' suggests a focus on the creation or development process. Both are equally common in spoken and written English, but 'planned' might have a slightly more formal tone.

'Projected' is another alternative, mostly used when referring to expected outcomes or results. It's more commonly seen in written reports or presentations as it carries a formal, analytical tone.

So, the next time you're outlining a new feature or discussing a product strategy, remember to clearly communicate your 'intended' goals or outcomes. It will not only articulate your plan but also reinforce the purpose behind your decisions.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: hone in. You've probably heard this phrase during product meetings or in casual work conversations, and it might have left you a bit puzzled. But don't worry, we're about to unpack it.

'Hone in' basically means to focus sharply on something, to narrow down your attention or effort on a particular aspect. It's like using a magnifying glass to examine a detail closely. This word is often used in the context of product discussions or planning, especially when we're talking about refining features, aligning strategies, or escalating issues. 

Let's imagine a scenario. You're in a product meeting, and the team is discussing a number of features for the next release. The conversation might be buzzing around various ideas, but then your project leader says: "Let's hone in on the user interface improvements for now." That means she wants the team to pay specific attention to refining the user interface, to really focus on making it better. 

Or consider a stakeholder update where the CEO says: "We need to hone in on our core priorities for the next quarter." That's a clear signal that the company needs to intensify its focus and resources on a specific set of goals. 

'Hone in' is used in both spoken and written communication, but it's commonly heard in meetings and discussions rather than seen in formal documents. 

If you're looking for alternatives, consider 'focus on' or 'concentrate on'. Both convey a similar meaning but 'focus on' is more casual and commonly used in spoken English, while 'concentrate on' is slightly more formal and often appears in written communication.

Remember, 'hone in' is all about sharpening your attention, zeroing in on something important. It's a powerful tool to use in your product discussions and planning. By using it, you'll align yourself with the precision and clarity expected in the UK business world.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: remain. 

In the realm of product management, the term "remain" is quite commonplace. This versatile verb isn't about standing still or being static. Instead, it refers to what's left after a change, or what continues to be true, even as conditions shift. Picture a roadmap discussion where priorities are constantly being reassessed, and you'll hear phrases like "We need to remain focused on our core features" or "The budget for Q3 remains unallocated." 

It?s often used in relation to things that stay constant, even as other aspects of a project or plan are in flux. For instance, you might say, "Despite changes in customer preferences, our mission remains the same." Or in a stakeholder update, "The need for data privacy remains our top priority."

The beauty of 'remain' is its applicability in both spoken and written communication. It's a word that helps you express constancy and persistence in a professional, yet accessible way. 

Now, how about some alternatives to 'remain'? One option is 'endure'. This is a tad more formal and suggests a sense of resilience or toughness. You could say, "Our commitment to quality endures, despite market fluctuations." It?s more commonly used in written communication, due to its slightly formal tone.

Another alternative is 'persist'. This word has a more casual tone and is commonly used in both spoken and written communication. So, in a product meeting, you might suggest, "We need to persist with our user testing, even if initial results are not as expected."

So, remember, 'remain' is about what continues to stay true or exist, even amidst change. It?s a staple in product discussions, planning, or decisions and is your ally in conveying steadiness and consistency.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: 'centered around'. Now, if you're preparing for a product manager role here in the UK, you'll find this phrase cropping up quite frequently in discussions, strategies, and meetings.

'Centered around' is a beautiful phrase that sits at the heart of any product discussion. It?s used to indicate the main focus or core idea of any project or strategy. Picture a circle, with your product or strategy right in the middle. Everything else - the planning, the brainstorming, the implementation - all of it revolves around that central point. That's exactly what 'centered around' means.

In the context of our product discussions, we might say: "Our new marketing strategy is centered around increasing user engagement." That tells everyone the core focus of the strategy is to boost user engagement.

Or let's say in a roadmap discussion, you might hear: "The next phase of product development is centered around enhancing user experience." This clearly indicates that improving the user experience is the core objective of the next phase.

'Centered around' is an incredibly versatile phrase. It's used in both spoken and written communication, making it a handy tool in your English language toolkit. 

Now, let's talk about some natural alternatives. You can say 'focused on' or 'revolves around'. These phrases carry the same meaning but might be used in slightly different contexts. 'Focused on' is often used when you want to emphasize a particular aspect or feature, while 'revolves around' gives a sense of everything being linked back to a single, central idea. 

'Centered around', 'focused on', 'revolves around' ? these are all key phrases that will allow you to clearly express the core of your product strategy, whether in a meeting with stakeholders, a team brainstorming session, or a written product update report. 

Remember, to communicate effectively in a UK business environment, especially in product management, it's not just about knowing the words, but understanding how and when to use them. And 'centered around' is certainly a phrase you'll want to have at the ready.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: layered on."

Picture this - you're in a meeting discussing the roadmap for your new product. Your team has already developed a solid base and now, you're considering adding additional features. This is where our word for today - "layered on" - comes into play. When we talk about something being "layered on", we're referring to additional elements or features being added to an existing product or plan.

You might hear it used in sentences like, "We have layered on new security features to enhance customer trust," or "Additional marketing strategies have been layered on to align with our sales priorities." It denotes a build-up, a progression, or an enhancement.

Let's take an example. Imagine you're in a product meeting discussing a new software release. You might say, "We've layered on a user-friendly interface to our existing software to improve user experience." In this context, "layered on" implies adding value to the existing product.

Or, you could be sharing an update with stakeholders about your product roadmap. You might say, "New features have been layered on to our app to escalate user engagement." Here, "layered on" signifies the strategic addition of features to elevate the product's appeal.

"Layered on" is versatile. It's used in both spoken and written communication, fitting perfectly in your everyday business English language.

Now, let's talk alternatives. You could use "added on", with a similar meaning, but it lacks the nuance of strategic enhancement that "layered on" implies. "Incorporated" is another alternative, sounding a bit more formal and is more common in written form.

Remember, "layered on" is about strategic enhancement, adding value, building upon what's already there. It's a term that resonates with the ongoing, evolving nature of product development in the UK business ecosystem.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: overshadowing. Picture this: you're in a product meeting, and one feature of your product is so impressive, so innovative, that it eclipses other significant aspects. This is when we use the term 'overshadowing'. 

In everyday conversations, especially in product planning or decision-making, 'overshadowing' is used to describe a situation where one element becomes so dominant that it makes others seem less important or noticeable. You may hear phrases like, "The new design is overshadowing our core functionality," or "Our marketing campaign shouldn't overshadow the product's value."

To give you a realistic example, imagine you're in a product roadmap discussion. Your team has worked hard to create a range of features for the upcoming release. However, there's this one AI feature that's so groundbreaking, it's all anyone talks about. You might say, "I'm concerned the AI feature is overshadowing the other improvements we've made. Let's ensure we communicate a balanced view to our stakeholders."

Another example could be in a stakeholder update meeting. "While our sales figures are impressive, I believe they're overshadowing the need for customer service improvements. We need to align with our priorities."

Overshadowing can be used in both spoken and written communication. It's a word that can give your discussions a depth of insight and nuance.

Now, if you're looking for alternatives to 'overshadowing', you could use 'eclipsing' or 'outshining'. 'Eclipsing' carries a similar nuance but is a bit more formal, often used in written communication. 'Outshining', on the other hand, is more casual and works well in spoken English, it also carries a more positive connotation, suggesting that something isn't just hidden, but is actually superior.

Remember, every feature, every element of your product has its own value. Don't let one bright star overshadow the rest of your galaxy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: third party intermediaries.

Imagine you're a product manager, developing a new software product. To ensure seamless integration with other software platforms, you might need to work with third party intermediaries. These intermediaries are essentially entities or individuals that act as middlemen. They bridge the gap between your company and another, facilitating communication, transactions or even conflict resolution. 

In your daily product discussions, you might say something like, 'We need to align our priorities with the third party intermediaries to ensure smooth system integration.' Or in planning stages, 'Let's opt in to receive updates from these intermediaries to stay informed about any changes.'

Here is a real-world example. You're in a product roadmap meeting and you're addressing a security concern with your product. You might say, 'We need to escalate this issue to our third-party intermediary to ensure the external software complies with our security standards.'

Third-party intermediaries play a crucial role in product development and management. Their usage is common in both written and spoken communication, especially when dealing with complex business relationships or integrations.

If you want to switch up your language a bit, you can also use terms like 'external facilitator' or 'mediator'. These are a bit more formal and are often used in written communication. In a less formal context, especially in spoken English, you might refer to them as 'middlemen'.

Remember, these intermediaries are key in establishing and maintaining productive business relationships and ensuring that your product functions at its best.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: demographic. 

Picture yourself in a product planning meeting. You're launching a new app and someone asks, "What's our target demographic?" Now, you might find yourself scratching your head. What's a demographic? Think of it as a specific slice of the population that your product is designed to attract. It's the age, gender, income, or interests of the people that you believe will be most interested in your product. 

In day to day communication, especially in product discussions, you'll often hear phrases like "demographic data," "demographic trends," or "demographic profile." It's a word that's intimately tied to understanding your users and aligning your product development with their needs. 

For instance, if you're discussing a new feature for a fitness app, you might say, "Our demographic analysis shows that our typical users are females aged 18 to 25, who are interested in yoga and healthy eating. We should consider integrating a diet tracking feature to align with their lifestyle." 

Or, in a stakeholder update, you might share: "Our demographic shift towards younger users suggests we should prioritise the development of social sharing features to attract this more social media savvy demographic."

Demographic is a word you'll encounter frequently in both written and spoken communication at work, from emails to meetings. 

Now, what if you want to mix up your vocabulary a bit? Well, you could use "target audience" or "consumer segment" in place of demographic. These alternatives carry similar meanings but with slight nuances. "Target audience" is often used when discussing marketing plans and is more common in spoken English. "Consumer segment," on the other hand, is a bit more formal and is typically found in written reports or strategic plans.

Remember, knowing your demographic is key to effective product management. It's about putting yourself in the shoes of your users and making sure your product is something they'll love and use.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: Trajectory.

Imagine you're launching a product that has been meticulously developed over months, even years. You've planned and projected its path of progress, its growth course, its, yes, trajectory. In business, particularly in product management, 'trajectory' often refers to the predicted path or development of a product, strategy, or company over time. It's a handy word to use in discussions about product planning, strategy meetings or stakeholder updates.

For instance, in a product meeting, you might hear, "Based on our current sales growth, the trajectory for our new app looks very promising." Or perhaps during a roadmap discussion, you might say, "Let's adjust the trajectory of our product development to align with market shifts." 

Not only does 'trajectory' help to convey direction and progress, but it also underscores the dynamism and forward momentum inherent in the product management process. It's used quite frequently in both spoken and written communication, making it an indispensable part of a product manager's vocabulary.

There are several synonyms for 'trajectory' that can add variety to your communication. 'Path', for example, is a more informal alternative, typically used in spoken English. It conveys a similar sense of direction, but with a slightly less formal tone. 'Course', on the other hand, is another alternative that's commonly used in both spoken and written English. It carries a similar meaning but often implies a fixed or predetermined direction.

Remember, 'trajectory' is about direction and progress over time. So, whether you're discussing product development, business strategy, or company growth, 'trajectory' can help you communicate these complex ideas in a clear and concise way.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: surface. Now, you might be thinking of the top layer of a table or desk, right? But in the realm of product management, 'surface' takes on a more dynamic role. 

In product discussions, especially in the UK, 'surface' often comes up in the context of bringing attention to a particular point or issue. Think of it as the process of taking something that's hidden or overlooked and bringing it to the 'surface' where it's visible and can be addressed.

The phrases you'll often hear are along the lines of 'surface the issue' or 'surface a concern'. For example, in a product meeting, you might say, "I'd like to surface a concern about user feedback on our latest release." Here, 'surface' is a polite way to introduce a potentially sensitive topic without sounding too abrupt or confrontational.

Another common usage is in the context of product planning, where 'surface' refers to the act of making something more prominent. Like, "We need to surface the key features in our roadmap discussions to align with our customer priorities."

Now, 'surface' is a versatile word. It's used in both spoken and written communication, but it's particularly helpful in live discussions or meetings where you need to bring focus to a point.

What about alternatives? 'Raise' and 'highlight' are two natural substitutes. 'Raise' is pretty informal and is more commonly used in spoken English, while 'highlight' is a tad more formal, more at home in written reports or emails.

So, the next time you're in a product meeting or drafting an update, don't hesitate to 'surface' your insights or concerns. I assure you, it's a fantastic way to assert your perspective professionally.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is 'compile'. Now, imagine you're a product manager, and you've been gathering data, ideas, or requirements from different sources ? say, customer feedback, team brainstorming sessions, or market research. You're essentially putting together a comprehensive set of information. Here, the word 'compile' comes into play. It essentially means to collect and arrange information or materials systematically in one place.

In our day-to-day product discussions or planning, we often use the term 'compile' to express the act of gathering and organizing information. For instance, you might hear a sentence like, 'We need to compile a report based on our user testing results' or 'Let's compile all the feature requests from our stakeholders before the next strategy meeting.' 

You see, 'compile' fits naturally into our communication when discussing the gathering of information or data. It's a versatile term, used in both written and spoken communication. 

To add a bit of variety to your English, there are a few alternatives to 'compile'. You could use 'assemble', a term that carries a slightly more formal tone and is often used in written communication. Or 'gather', a more casual and commonly spoken term. Finally, 'collate' is a great alternative, especially when you're stressing the careful ordering or arrangement of data. 

Remember, 'compile' isn't just about collecting; it's also about organizing that collection systematically, which is a crucial part of a product manager's role.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: tune in to.

Imagine yourself in a bustling office, surrounded by your team, all eager to make the next big product launch a resounding success. In such a setting, the phrase 'tune in to' often becomes part of your everyday vocabulary. But what does it mean? 

When you 'tune in to' something, you focus your attention or attune your understanding to it. It's like tuning a radio to a preferred station to catch your favourite show. In the context of product management, you might 'tune in to' customer needs, market trends, or even internal team dynamics. When we say, 'Let's tune in to our customer feedback', we mean let's focus on, listen carefully to, and understand what our customers are telling us.

Let's delve into a couple of real-life examples. In a product meeting, your team leader might say, 'We need to tune in to the latest user analytics to align with our priorities for the next sprint.' Or in a roadmap discussion, you might hear, 'Our stakeholders have expressed some concerns, let's tune in to their thoughts to ensure we're escalating the right issues.'

So, 'tune in to' is a versatile phrase that you're likely to encounter in both written and spoken communication, be it in emails, meeting notes, or face-to-face discussions.

Now, if you'd like to switch things up a bit, there are a few natural alternatives to 'tune in to.' You might use 'pay attention to' or 'focus on,' which convey a similar meaning but are perhaps a tad more formal. For a more casual tone, especially in spoken English, you could say 'catch up on.' Each of these alternatives, like 'tune in to,' underscores the importance of being attuned to the dynamics of product management.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: curated. Picture yourself at an art gallery. The best pieces have been handpicked and arranged for a unique, impactful experience. That's essentially what 'curated' means in our product and business context. It's about selecting, organising, and presenting items or information in a way that provides the most value for our customers.

In our daily communication, we often use 'curated' when we're planning or making decisions about our product offerings. For example, a product manager might say, 'We've curated this list of features to align with our customer's priorities.' This means they've carefully chosen and organised those features to meet the needs and expectations of the customers.

Another instance could be during a roadmap discussion: 'Our Q3 roadmap is a curated strategy that reflects the feedback we've received from our stakeholders.' Here, 'curated' indicates that the strategy has been thoughtfully put together using valuable insights from the stakeholders.

'Curated' is a versatile word used in both spoken and written communication. Its synonym 'selected' is a bit more formal and typically found in written English. 'Handpicked' is a more casual alternative, often used in spoken English. 'Chosen' is a straightforward replacement, suitable for both spoken and written contexts.

So, next time you're talking about your product offerings or a strategy, remember, you're not just selecting. You're curating. You're creating a tailored, meaningful experience for your customers, stakeholders, or anyone else who interacts with your product.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: forefront. Imagine you're in a meeting, and your lead engineer says, "Our latest security features are at the forefront of the industry." Now, what does that mean? Simply put, "forefront" refers to the leading or most important position or place. It's often used to highlight something as cutting-edge or pioneering.

In the bustling discussions of product meetings or roadmap planning, "forefront" is the word you use when you want to emphasize that your product, feature, or strategy is ahead of the curve, leading the pack, or setting the trends. It's a powerful word that can showcase your commitment to innovation and progress. 

Let's bring this to life with a couple of examples. Picture this, you're presenting your quarter's roadmap to stakeholders, and you say, "Our user-centric design approach places us at the forefront of the market." You've just conveyed that your strategy is innovative and leading in the industry. Or perhaps, in a team meeting, you might say, "Let's keep the customer's needs at the forefront of our decision-making process." Here, you've stressed that customer needs are the most important consideration in your decisions.

Although "forefront" can be used in both spoken and written communication, it has a slightly more formal tone, making it ideal for business meetings, reports, or professional presentations. 

If you want to use other words that convey a similar idea, consider "vanguard", "cutting-edge", or "pioneering". These alternatives also suggest being ahead or leading, but remember, "vanguard" carries a more formal tone and is often used in written communication, while "cutting-edge" and "pioneering" are more conversational and commonly used in both spoken and written English.

So, the next time you want to highlight your product's advanced features, or your market-leading strategy, remember the word "forefront". It could be the perfect way to convey your message with conviction and confidence.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is a phrase we often use in our product discussions - 'support somebody in doing something.'

Picture this, you're at a product planning meeting and your colleague has proposed a new feature for the next software update. You think it's a great idea and decide to back it, so you tell him, 'I will support you in implementing this feature.' In this context, 'support somebody in doing something' means that you are offering your help, resources, or expertise to facilitate someone in completing a task or achieving a goal.

In daily communication, especially in product discussions, planning, or decisions, we often use this phrase. For instance, it's common to say, 'I support the team in aligning with our priorities,' which implies that you help your team focus on the key tasks. Or in another scenario, you might say, 'We need to support our customers in opting in to receive updates,' which means you need to ensure your customers have the necessary help to receive your product updates.

Let's consider an example. During a product meeting, you might say, 'I'm here to support you in escalating any issues that arise during the development process.' This means you're ready to assist your team in raising any problems that might occur. Or while discussing the product roadmap with stakeholders, you could say, 'We will support our users in transitioning to the new interface.' Here, you're communicating that you'll help your users adapt to the changes in your product.

Now, this phrase is versatile and can be used in both spoken and written communication. It's a polite and professional way of assuring help and cooperation, making it ideal for the UK business environment.

Looking for alternatives? A few come to mind. 'Assist somebody in doing something' is one. It's pretty formal and more common in written business English. 'Help somebody do something' is another, slightly less formal, and used more in spoken English. 'Back somebody in doing something' is a more colloquial way to express the same idea, and is mostly used in spoken English.

Remember, 'support somebody in doing something' is about offering help, resources, or expertise to facilitate a task or goal. When you use it, you're not just communicating cooperation, but also a sense of teamwork and partnership, which is key in any product management role.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: viable.

Imagine you're in a product meeting, and you're discussing whether a particular solution is feasible or not. One of your colleagues might ask, "Is this a viable option?" In this context, 'viable' means something that's doable, realistic, and capable of working successfully. It's a useful term when you're assessing the practicality of product features, strategies, or even timelines.

People often talk about a 'viable product', which means a product that is at a stage where it can be launched and will function successfully in the market. They may also refer to a 'viable solution', indicating a workable answer to a problem. This term is also used in phrases like 'viable alternative' or 'viable option', pointing towards a feasible choice or substitute.

Let's dive into a couple of examples to give you a feel for how it's used. Picture yourself in a roadmap discussion. You might say, "In order to meet our Q4 goal, launching the new feature in August is the only viable option." Or, in a stakeholder update, you could report, "We've explored multiple avenues and found a viable solution to the customer retention issue."

The word 'viable' is versatile. It's equally used in both spoken and written communication, and it's a valuable addition to your professional vocabulary. 

When it comes to alternatives, you could use words like 'feasible', 'practical', or 'workable'. For instance, 'feasible' is more formal and often used in written communication. 'Practical' is more neutral and common in everyday language. 'Workable', meanwhile, is slightly informal and often used in spoken English. Each of these words has a slightly different nuance, but they all fit into a similar context.

Remember, using 'viable' and its alternatives correctly can significantly enhance your clarity and professionalism in English business communication.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: cannibalize. 

Now, you might be thinking of something prehistoric, but don't worry, we're in the business world here. In our context, to 'cannibalize' means one product's growth or success is eating into, or reducing, the success of another product within the same company. It's a term you'll often hear in product discussions, particularly when strategising new launches or assessing the impact on existing product lines. 

For instance, imagine you're at a product planning meeting. You might hear someone say, 'If we launch this new smartphone model now, we risk cannibalizing sales of our current flagship model.' That's the word 'cannibalize' in action. It's a way of expressing concern that the new product could diminish the performance of an existing one.

It's also common in stakeholder updates. For example, 'We need to assess whether the new software update will cannibalize our existing premium package. We need to align our product development with business priorities to avoid such scenarios.' 

So, 'cannibalize' is a term you'll hear in both spoken and written communication, especially in strategic and update meetings. It's a useful word to have in your PM vocabulary.

But, of course, English is rich with synonyms. You could also say 'undermine' or 'detract from'. These terms are a bit softer than 'cannibalize', and they're often used in more casual, spoken English. However, they don't quite capture the same sense of internal competition that 'cannibalize' does. 

Another alternative is 'encroach upon'. This is a bit more formal and it's typically used in written English, especially in analytical reports. It implies a gradual intrusion or reduction, rather than the direct impact conveyed by 'cannibalize'. 

So there you have it, 'cannibalize', a word that captures the internal product competition and its potential impact on a company's success. Remember to use it when discussing product strategies and assessing the potential impact of new launches on your company's existing product lines.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: looking ahead. 

Now, in the world of product management, 'looking ahead' is all about proactively anticipating and preparing for what's next. It's about mapping out future steps or strategies based on current insights and trends. We often use this phrase in product discussions when we're talking about planning for the next quarter or envisaging the product's roadmap for the upcoming year. 

In daily communication, it's common to hear phrases like, 'When looking ahead to our Q4 release, we need to align with priorities and escalate any potential issues early on.' Or perhaps, 'Looking ahead, we should opt in to receive updates from our marketing team to ensure we're all on the same page.' These examples reflect how 'looking ahead' is used in real-life workplace situations, such as product meetings or stakeholder updates.

'Looking ahead' is used both in spoken and written communication. You might hear it during a strategy meeting, read it in an email, or even see it in a presentation. It's a versatile phrase that signifies forward-thinking and proactive planning.

Now, if you want to switch things up a bit, there are a few natural alternatives to 'looking ahead.' You could say 'planning for the future,' which has a more formal tone and is typically seen in written communication. Or 'anticipating what's next,' a more conversational phrase often used in casual spoken discussions. Remember, these alternatives carry the same general meaning but may be used differently depending on the formality and context.

So, the next time you find yourself in a product discussion or a planning meeting, don't hesitate to use 'looking ahead.' It's a simple yet powerful way to show that you're proactive, prepared, and ready to lead your team into the future.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "granular". Now, this isn't about sand or sugar, but a term often used in business and product management discussions. 

When we say something is "granular" in a product context, we're talking about a high level of detail. It's like zooming in on a digital image until you can see each individual pixel. For example, when planning a new product feature, a project manager might ask her team for a "granular analysis" ? she's asking for thorough, detailed information, broken down into its smallest, most basic elements. 

In daily communication, "granular" might pop up in discussions about product roadmaps or when addressing stakeholder concerns. A product manager might say, "Let's get granular on this user feedback to understand the specific issues and align them with our priorities." That means dissecting the feedback to understand every single element and how it relates to the product's overall objectives.

Another example could be in a meeting where you're discussing a product-related issue that needs to be escalated. You might hear, "We need a more granular report to escalate this to senior management." Here, "granular" is all about giving a detailed, comprehensive report that leaves no stone unturned.

"Granular" is widely used in both spoken and written communication, whether in meetings, reports, or emails. It's a versatile word that conveys the need for detail and precision.

Now, let's look at some alternatives. You might hear "detailed" or "in-depth" used in similar contexts. These words also express the need for thoroughness, but "granular" implies a level of detail down to the smallest, most basic elements. Another alternative is "specific," which is more casual and commonly used in spoken English.

So, next time you're in a product meeting, don't hesitate to get "granular". It's a valuable word that shows your understanding of a concept down to its most detailed level, and it's a surefire way to impress your UK colleagues.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: granularity. 

Now, you may be familiar with the term from your science or computer classes, where it refers to the detail or precision of data. In the business context, especially in the realm of product management, granularity carries a similar meaning - it's about the level of detail in a discussion, analysis, or decision. It's like zooming in or out on a map; some discussions need a city view and others need a street view.

In daily communication, you might hear phrases like, "We need more granularity in this product roadmap," or "The granularity of our user feedback is helping us prioritise our next steps." Here, the first phrase means we need to break down our product roadmap into more detailed steps. The second phrase implies that detailed user feedback is helping us align our actions with user priorities.

So, let's dive into a couple of examples. You're in a product planning meeting and your director says, "Can we add more granularity to these user stories?" They're asking for more specific detail in the user stories to better understand user needs and behaviours. Or maybe you're presenting a stakeholder update and you say, "The granularity of our market analysis has allowed us to identify some niche segments." Here, you're saying that a detailed market analysis has helped identify specific customer segments.

Remember, granularity refers to the level of detail. It can be used in both spoken and written communication, and it's especially useful when discussing data, analysis, or plans. 

If you're looking for alternatives, consider 'detail', 'specificity', or 'precision'. 'Detail' is a general term and can be used in both spoken and written English. 'Specificity' carries a bit more formality, often seen in written reports, while 'precision' is more common in technical or data-driven conversations.

So that's it for today. Remember, next time you are in a meeting and need to discuss details, don't shy away from using the term 'granularity'. It's a great way to show your understanding of the product and the market it serves.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: paramount.

Imagine you're in a product planning meeting, and your team leader emphasizes, 'The user experience is paramount to our product's success.' What she means is that the user experience is of utmost importance. It's crucial, it's critical, it's the top priority?it's paramount. 

Used in such context, the term 'paramount' is a way to highlight the significance of a particular aspect in a business or product scenario. It?s a word that doesn't just imply importance, it underlines it, bolds it, and puts a bright highlighter over it.

For example, you might hear, 'Ensuring that our launch aligns with the marketing team's schedule is paramount'. That means that aligning schedules is not just a nice-to-have, but a must-do, a top-tier priority. Or in a roadmap discussion, someone might say, 'It's paramount that we iterate quickly based on customer feedback.' Again, the message is clear: quick iteration is not optional?it's absolutely essential.

You'll find 'paramount' used in both spoken and written communication, making it a versatile addition to your professional vocabulary. It?s a word that carries weight and signals urgency, making it a powerful tool when discussing priorities or pressing issues.

Now, if you're looking for alternatives, 'critical' and 'crucial' are two that come to mind. 'Critical' is often used in more formal, written communications, like in a report or a business email. 'Crucial', on the other hand, is less formal and more common in spoken English. Both words carry a similar weight to 'paramount', but with slightly different tones.

So, remember: when something is paramount, it's more than just important?it's a top priority. It's a word that underscores the gravity of a situation or task, and it?s a term that will add a sense of authority and urgency to your business language.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: fall short of. 

When you 'fall short of' something, it means you haven't quite reached an expected standard or goal. It's a phrase we often use in product management when we discuss how a product or a feature didn't meet our expectations or targets. It could be in terms of sales numbers, user adoption, or even how well it aligns with our strategic priorities.

Let's imagine you're in a product meeting, and you're discussing last quarter's performance of your new app. You might say, "Our user sign-ups for the new app fell short of our projections by 20%." This means that the sign-ups didn't reach the projected numbers, they were 20% less. 

Or perhaps you're in a roadmap discussion about upcoming features. You could say, "We don't want our new feature to fall short of our customer's expectations, so let's ensure we conduct rigorous user testing before we launch."

Falling short isn't a failure, it's a valuable learning opportunity. It helps us identify areas for improvement and triggers critical thinking about how to adjust our strategies to achieve better results in the future. 

'Fall short of' is used in both spoken and written communication. It's a common phrase you'll hear in meetings, and you'll also see it in emails or reports. 

Some natural alternatives to 'fall short of' include 'did not meet,' 'didn't reach,' or 'undershot.' For instance, you could say, "We didn't meet our sales target," or "Our feature release undershot our expectations." These phrases are slightly more formal and are usually used in written communication. 

Remember, 'falling short' simply means there's room for growth and improvement. It's a key part of the product management journey to set ambitious goals, assess our performance, and continuously strive for better.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: brief. 

In the world of product management, 'brief' is one of those words that carries more weight than its size suggests. It's not just about being concise, although that's part of it. A 'brief' is a document or a set of instructions that gives clear, succinct guidance on a project or task. It?s the roadmap that steers your team's efforts, helping to align everyone's work with the overall project goals.

In daily communication, you might hear someone say, "Could you draft a brief for the new marketing strategy?" or "We need a design brief to kickstart our next product iteration." In these cases, 'brief' refers to a document that outlines the project's objectives, key steps, stakeholders involved, and expected outcomes.

In a product meeting, a manager might say, "Let's review the brief before we dive into the details." This phrase underscores the importance of understanding the project's overall direction before getting into the nitty-gritty. 

On the other hand, when someone says, "I'll keep this brief," it means they'll provide only the essential information, without unnecessary details. For instance, in a stakeholder update, a product manager might say, "I'll keep this brief, our new feature has been well-received by the beta testers, and we are ready for a full launch next week."

'Brief' is often used in both spoken and written communication. It's an essential part of the product manager's vocabulary, helping to ensure clarity and focus in team communication.

Now, let me introduce a couple of natural alternatives for 'brief'. One is 'outline'. Similar to 'brief', an 'outline' provides a clear, organized overview of a project. It's commonly used in written communication.

Another alternative is 'summary'. A 'summary' is a condensed version of a more extensive document or discussion. It's more casual and is frequently used in spoken English.

Remember, while 'brief' and its alternatives share certain similarities, the nuances in their usage can add richness and variety to your business English.

High-net-worth clients, or HNW clients for short, are what we call those individuals or organizations with a significant amount of wealth. Usually, they have investable assets over a certain amount, often a million pounds or more. 

In the product management world, understanding and catering to the needs of high-net-worth clients can be a crucial aspect of our work. For instance, when strategizing for a new product, you might ask, 'How does this align with the preferences of our high-net-worth clients?' Or during a roadmap discussion, we may find ourselves saying, 'Let's ensure this feature caters to our high-net-worth clients who opt in to receive updates.'

Let's paint a more detailed picture. Imagine you're in a product meeting discussing a new investment app. You might hear, 'Our research shows high-net-worth clients prefer a personal touch, so let's incorporate a dedicated account manager feature.' Or, in a stakeholder update, you might say, 'We're seeing great uptake from our high-net-worth clients since escalating this issue in the design phase.'

High-net-worth clients is a term you'll find in both spoken and written communication. It's a formal way to refer to this specific demographic, but it?s also quite common in everyday business talk.

Now, let's look at a few alternatives. You might hear 'wealthy clients' or 'affluent customers.' These phrases are less formal and perhaps more common in spoken English. However, they lack the precision of 'high-net-worth clients,' which specifically refers to a certain level of wealth.

So, to recap, when talking about high-net-worth clients, we're referring to individuals or organizations with substantial wealth. It's a term that can shape our product discussions, planning, and decisions, and it's used in both spoken and written communication.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: cost-effective. It's a term that carries a lot of weight in our product management world. So, what does it mean? In simple terms, being cost-effective is about achieving the best possible outcome at the lowest possible expense. It's a balancing act between resources and results. When we say a product or a solution is cost-effective, we're saying it gives us excellent value for the money invested.

Now, in our daily product discussions, the term cost-effective often comes up in roadmap meetings or when we're assessing different options. It's a phrase we might use to align with our priorities, like when we're deciding whether to opt in to receive updates from a particular software vendor, or when we're considering whether to escalate an issue to our senior management.

Let's look at a couple of examples. Picture a meeting where you're discussing a potential upgrade to your company's CRM system. You might say, 'While the new version offers a range of advanced features, we need to confirm if it's cost-effective, considering our budget constraints and business needs.' Or, you're in a stakeholder update call, you might use the term to reassure your audience, saying, 'We're thoroughly evaluating all options to ensure our approach is cost-effective and aligns with our strategic goals.'

Cost-effective is a term that you'll find in both written and spoken communication. It's a clear, succinct way to express the idea of getting the most value for your money.

If you feel like mixing it up a bit, there are a few alternatives that you can use. 'Economical' is a good one, often used in a similar context but perhaps a bit more informally. 'Value for money' is another phrase that conveys a similar meaning, and it's commonly used in spoken English. Another term you could consider is 'budget-friendly,' which is a bit less formal and more commonly used in advertising or promotional materials.

So there you have it. Cost-effective is all about balancing resources and results, aiming for the best outcome at the lowest expense. It's a powerful word that can help you express your decisions and strategies effectively in the realm of product management.

  <title>Word 142 - Compel</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: compel. 

Imagine this. You're in a product meeting, and the Head of Sales is talking about a new feature they believe will drive sales. They present a convincing case, with strong data and customer feedback. You feel strongly influenced to include this feature in your product roadmap. You are, in essence, 'compelled' to do so. And that's our word for today - compel. 

In the business world, especially in product discussions or decisions, 'compel' means to be driven or urged forcefully or irresistibly to do something. It's about that internal push you feel when the evidence or argument is so strong that it seems like the only logical course of action. 

Here's another example. Let's say you're preparing a stakeholder update, and you want to stress the importance of adopting a new technology. You might say, "The potential for efficiency gains compels us to consider this technology seriously." So, 'compel' is often used when you're trying to influence others or express a strong belief in a path of action. 

'Compel' is versatile. It's equally at home in spoken communication, like in meetings or presentations, as well as in written communication, like emails or reports. 

But of course, we don't always have to use 'compel'. Sometimes, you might want to soften the tone. In these cases, you could use 'persuade' or 'convince', which are less forceful. Or perhaps you want to maintain the level of urgency but sound a bit more formal. 'Impel' would be a good fit here. While these words can be used interchangeably with 'compel', they offer subtle differences in tone and formality, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your message and audience. 

Remember, the key with 'compel' is its sense of urgency and irresistibility. It's about being so convinced or influenced by something that you feel you must act. 

So the next time you're in a product meeting or drafting a key stakeholder update, consider if there's anything compelling you to a particular course of action, and if so, don't be afraid to use the word 'compel'.

  <title>Word 143 - Remuneration</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: remuneration. Now, you might be thinking, "What's that?" Well, let's dive right in. 

In the business world, and especially in the role of a product manager, remuneration is a key concept. It's the term we use to talk about compensation for work or services. Think about it as the total package of pay, bonuses, and benefits that you receive for your contribution to the company. 

For example, in a team meeting, you might hear, "The remuneration package for the new product manager will align with our company's compensation standards and reflect the responsibilities of the role." Here, remuneration is used to discuss the financial aspect of a job offer.

Or, during a roadmap discussion, the topic of remuneration might come up in connection with resource allocation. You might say, "We need to consider the remuneration of our external consultants when planning the budget for the next quarter."

Now that we've seen it in action, let's circle back. Remuneration isn't a word you'd use in casual chats around the watercooler. It's more common in formal contexts - both in spoken and written communication, such as in meetings, emails or reports.

Now, if you want to switch it up a bit, there are a couple of alternatives. 'Compensation' is a good one, often used interchangeably with remuneration. It's a bit less formal and widely used in both spoken and written forms. 'Pay' is another alternative, more casual, and typically used in spoken English.

Remember, language is about expressing ideas, not just using big, fancy words. So, whether you use 'remuneration', 'compensation', or 'pay', what matters is that your message is clear.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: forecast. Picture this, you're in a meeting, and you hear the phrase, 'We need to forecast our product sales for the next quarter.' But what does forecast actually mean in this context? 

In the realm of product management, forecast is a projection or an estimation of what will happen in the future. It's about using data, trends, and insights to predict outcomes for your product. It's a critical part of decision-making, planning and strategising. 

You'd typically hear 'forecast' used in phrases such as ?sales forecast?, ?demand forecast?, or ?forecast accuracy?. It's a word that frequently pops up in our product discussions, roadmap planning, and especially when we align with priorities and set our product strategies. 

Let's dive into an example. Imagine you're in a product meeting, and your team is discussing the launch of a new feature. You might hear something like, 'Based on our forecast, we predict a 15% increase in user engagement with this new feature.' Or in a stakeholder update, you might say, 'Our forecast shows that we should be able to escalate our production by 20% to meet the expected demand.' 

So, forecast is a term that we use in both spoken and written communication, particularly when we're discussing projections for our product. It's a word that carries weight, adding a sense of evidence and credibility to our discussions and decisions.

Now, if you're looking for alternative words to 'forecast', you could use 'projection' or 'estimation'. 'Projection' has a similar formality and is common in both spoken and written communication. It feels a bit more definite, as if you're casting the future from the present. 'Estimation', on the other hand, feels slightly less formal. It's more about giving your best guess based on the information you have. 

Remember, the purpose of forecasts, projections, or estimations is to give us and our stakeholders an informed view of the future. It allows us to align our team's efforts to meet our product's goals.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word is: "insight in". Now, when you're in the world of product management, you'll hear the term 'insight in' quite frequently. This phrase isn't about peeping into something; rather, it's about understanding or gaining a deeper knowledge of something important to your product, its performance, or the market.

Imagine you're in a meeting and a colleague says, "We need some insight in how this feature is performing." What they're really asking for is a thorough analysis or understanding of how well the feature is doing. It's like saying, 'let's dig deeper and find out what's really going on here.'

You might also hear it in discussions about planning or decisions. For example, "Our roadmap for the next quarter needs some insight in customer preferences." In this case, they're talking about including an understanding of what the customer prefers or values in your planning process.

Now, let?s not forget common collocations or phrases that typically go hand in hand with our word. You might opt in to receive updates, escalate an issue or align your findings with the business priorities. 

So, you see, 'insight in' is a handy phrase to have in your repertoire. It's equally prevalent in written and spoken communication, so you can confidently use it in emails, reports, meetings or casual workplace discussions.

If you're looking for alternatives, consider 'understanding of', 'knowledge about', or 'grasp on'. These phrases carry a similar meaning but offer a slight shift in tone. 'Understanding of' and 'knowledge about' are more formal and might be more suitable for written communication, while 'grasp on' has a more casual, conversational feel, making it perfect for spoken English.

Remember, the goal is to communicate effectively and confidently. The better your insight in product management language, the better you?ll navigate the UK business scene.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: insight into. When we talk about having 'insight into' something, we're referring to a deep understanding or clear perception of it. In the context of product management, it could be about gaining a detailed comprehension of a product's performance, user behaviour, or market trends.

This term often pops up in discussions around data analysis or research findings. For instance, you might hear a product manager say, 'Our customer survey has given us valuable insight into what features our users value the most.' Here, 'insight into' is used to express a newfound understanding of the user's preferences, which can subsequently inform product decisions.

Another example would be in a roadmap discussion. You might say, 'We need further insight into the technical feasibility before we can align it with our Q4 priorities.' In this case, 'insight into' is used to signify the need for more information or understanding before making a strategic decision.

Now, 'insight into' is a versatile term, equally common in both spoken and written communication. It's used informally in everyday conversations but also finds its place in more formal settings like business presentations or reports.

If you're looking for alternatives, consider 'understanding of,' 'knowledge about,' or 'grasp on.' These phrases are slightly less formal and more common in spoken English. However, they convey a similar meaning, indicating a deep comprehension of a particular subject.

Just remember, gaining 'insight into' something is more than just knowing about it. It's about truly understanding it and being able to make informed decisions based on that understanding. So, whether you're brainstorming features, analysing user data, or laying out your product roadmap, always seek deeper insight. It's your key to making informed, impactful decisions.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is a phrase, actually: 'schedule something for sometime.' When we use this phrase in product management, it's about organising a task, meeting, or event to happen at a specific time in the future. It's a crucial term in our daily operations; it helps us keep on track, meet deadlines, and manage our project timelines effectively.

Let's say you're planning a product launch. You might say, "We need to schedule the product demo for next Tuesday". Or sometimes, we use it to align with our priorities, like, "Let's schedule the stakeholder meeting for after we've received the client feedback". 

Here's an example from a typical product discussion. Imagine you are in a roadmap planning session. You might suggest, "Given the complexities of the new feature, we should schedule the design review for sometime next week. This will give us enough time to escalate any issues and opt in to receive updates from the design team".

'Schedule something for sometime' is used in both spoken and written communication. It's a clear, straightforward way to organise your time and tasks, whether you're speaking in a meeting or writing an email.

Now, let's look at a few alternatives. 'Arrange' and 'plan' could be used in place of 'schedule.' For instance, you might say, "Let's arrange a follow-up meeting for sometime next week" or "We need to plan a brainstorming session for later this month". These terms are slightly less formal than 'schedule', but they all serve the same purpose: to organise a future event or task. 

If you want to be more informal, especially in spoken English, you can use the term 'set up.' For instance, "We need to set up a meeting with the stakeholders for next week". 

Remember, the key here is to be clear about the task that needs to be addressed and the time frame in which it should occur. This is an essential skill for a product manager, particularly in a fast-paced business environment like ours in the UK.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: lack in.

Picture this: you're overseeing a product launch in the UK. The team has been working hard, but the latest feedback suggests there's something missing. You might say the product 'lacks in' user-friendliness. This phrase, 'lack in', is a way to express that something is deficient or inadequate in a certain aspect. It's a gentle, constructive way to point out areas for improvement, especially in product discussions or planning.

Let me paint you a scenario. Imagine you're in a roadmap discussion and you notice the timeline doesn't align with the priorities. You might say, "The roadmap seems to lack in terms of alignment with our strategic priorities." Here, 'lack in' identifies a gap without sounding too harsh. It's a productive way to escalate an issue and initiate a problem-solving conversation.

Another example could be during a stakeholder update. Maybe the recent market analysis shows your product lacks in comparison to competitors on price point. You'd express this as, "Our product appears to lack in competitive pricing." 

'Lack in' is a versatile phrase used both in spoken and written communication. It's particularly useful in emails, reports, and presentations, as well as face-to-face meetings or video calls. Using 'lack in' shows your understanding of the situation and your willingness to address shortcomings in a professional, thoughtful manner.

Now, let's explore some alternatives. 'Fall short' is a common one. If you say, "Our marketing strategy falls short in customer engagement," it's slightly less formal but conveys the same general idea. This is often used in spoken English. Another alternative is 'is deficient in', which is more formal and more common in written communication. For example, "Our prototype is deficient in user experience."

Remember, using 'lack in' and its alternatives can help you constructively address gaps and take proactive steps towards improvement. It's a key tool in your communication toolbox as a Product Manager in the UK.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: rewind. Picture a cassette tape, the spools going backwards to return to a previous point ? that's exactly what we're doing when we "rewind" in a product management context. We're going back to reevaluate, reassess or revisit a product decision, strategy or feature. In daily communication, particularly during product discussions or planning, the word "rewind" is frequently used.

For example, let's say you've just launched a new feature but it's not delivering the expected results. You may tell your team, "We need to rewind and relook at our user research to understand what went wrong." Or in a roadmap discussion, you might say, "Let's rewind to Q1 and realign our priorities."

It's not a term to be used lightly, as it often signifies a strategic change or a need for deeper analysis. But it can be a powerful tool for ensuring your product stays on the right track. The word "rewind" can be used in both spoken and written communication, but it's especially common during meetings or written updates.

If you're looking for alternatives, consider "go back", "reconsider", or "revisit". The word "go back" is casual and often used in spoken English, while "reconsider" is a bit more formal, suitable for written communication or formal meetings. "Revisit", on the other hand, is neutral and can be used in both spoken and written English.

Remember, using the term "rewind" confidently can show your willingness to learn from past experiences and make necessary adjustments, a valuable trait in the product management world. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s phrase is: 'inform somebody in'. 

When we talk about 'informing somebody in', we're talking about giving someone specific information. It's a key phrase to use when you want to update a stakeholder about a product, or when you're looking to align your team with the latest priorities. It's about keeping everyone in the loop, ensuring the right people have the right information at the right time. 

In product discussions or planning, we often use this phrase to ensure clarity and transparency among team members. For instance, you might hear someone say, 'I've informed John in Marketing about our latest user research findings.' This means you've given John the necessary details about something he needs to know for his role.

Or consider this: 'Before the roadmap meeting, we need to inform the stakeholders in about our new product launch strategy.' Here, you're updating your stakeholders about a key decision or plan.

'Inform somebody in' is used in both spoken and written communication, from team meetings to email threads. It's a professional and polite way to convey that you've shared important information, and it's essential in maintaining open lines of communication.

Now, let's talk about a few alternatives to this phrase. You might say 'update someone on' or 'bring someone up to speed'. Both of these are a bit less formal, and are more commonly used in spoken English. But they carry the same basic meaning: you're giving someone new information they need to do their job.

Remember, the key to using 'inform somebody in' confidently is understanding it's about more than just giving information. It's about fostering clear, open communication to keep projects moving smoothly.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: high-stake. Now, when you hear 'high-stake', you might think of poker chips being pushed to the center of the table in a tense game of poker. Well, it's not too far from the truth in our product management world. A high-stake situation or decision refers to one that carries significant impact or risk. If it goes well, the rewards can be substantial, but if it goes poorly, the consequences could be severe.

Let's think about this in terms of a product launch. If a new product is considered high-stake, it means there's a lot riding on its success. This could be a company's reputation, a significant investment, or the potential to revolutionise the market. And so, the decisions around it, like the marketing strategy, pricing, or even the launch date, become high-stake decisions. 

For instance, you might hear someone in a product meeting say, 'We need to carefully consider our options for this high-stake product launch.' Or during a roadmap discussion, 'Given the high-stake nature of this project, we need to align with our top priorities and ensure there's no room for error.' 

High-stake is used just as much in written communication as it is in spoken. It's a powerful term that immediately communicates the importance and sensitivity of a situation or decision.

Now, if you want to mix things up a bit, you can use alternatives such as 'critical', 'crucial', or 'pivotal'. These words carry a similar weight, but 'critical' and 'crucial' often convey a sense of urgency, while 'pivotal' leans more towards a turning point or a decision that can significantly alter the course of events. Generally, these are also used in both spoken and written English. 

Remember, using the term 'high-stake' can help emphasise the importance of a situation and the need for careful planning and decision-making.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: press. 

When you hear the word 'press', what comes to mind? Newspapers, buttons, or maybe a heavy workout at the gym? But in the business world, and particularly in product management, 'press' takes on a slightly different meaning. It's all about applying pressure or urgency to a task, a person, or a situation. 

Picture this: you're in a product planning meeting and the release date is fast approaching. You might hear your team lead say, "We need to press on with the development to meet the launch date." Here, 'press on' signifies the need to continue with determination or urgency.

You might also hear it in the context of pressing issues. For instance, "We need to address these pressing issues before the product launch." In this case, 'pressing' refers to problems that are urgent and need immediate attention.

The beauty of the word 'press' is that it's versatile. It can be used in both spoken and written communication. You can use it in meetings, emails, or even in casual chats with your colleagues.

Now, let's talk about some alternatives. You might replace 'press' with 'push'. For example, "We need to push on with the final testing phase." 'Push' is a bit less formal and is used more often in spoken English. Another alternative is 'urge'. "I urge you to consider these changes before the product release." 'Urge' is slightly more formal and is often used in written communication to stress the importance of an action.

Remember, 'press' doesn't always mean physical pressure. In the product management world, it can highlight the urgency of a task or issue. So, next time you're in a meeting or drafting an email, don't hesitate to press your point or press on with your suggestions.

Picture this: you're in a product meeting, and your team is brainstorming innovative features for the next phase of development. Suddenly, someone brings up an idea that was discussed weeks ago but never resolved. They say, 'Let's cycle back to the concept of integrating AI.' What they mean is, 'Let's revisit or return to that idea.' 

Yes, 'cycle back' is a useful term in product management discussions. It's a polite, casual way of saying that we should reconsider an idea, a decision, or a topic from an earlier point in our discussion or process. It?s about aligning with priorities and escalating issues that need attention, even if they were previously left aside.

Imagine you're in a roadmap discussion. Your team is making strategic decisions about what to focus on for the next quarter. You feel it's essential not to forget the user feedback that was gathered but not yet acted upon. You might say, 'We need to cycle back to the user feedback we received last month before we finalize our plans.'

Cycle back is predominantly used in spoken communication, but you can also find it in written updates, especially when referring to a point discussed in prior meetings or emails.

Now, let's talk about alternatives. You can say 'go back,' 'revisit,' or 'return to.' These phrases have a similar meaning but may vary in formality. 'Revisit' is slightly more formal and often used in written communication, while 'go back' and 'return to' are more casual and common in spoken English.

So, next time you're in a product meeting or writing an update, and you want to bring attention back to a previously discussed idea, don't hesitate to use 'cycle back.' It's a natural, effective way to ensure important points are not overlooked in the ongoing development process.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: break down barriers. 

Imagine you're launching a new product, but you're facing resistance from different departments. You have marketing concerned about messaging, sales worried about pricing, and customer service anxious about support. What you're experiencing are barriers, and your task is to break them down. 

To break down barriers in a business context means to overcome obstacles or challenges that hinder progress. It's about fostering understanding, collaboration, and consensus among various stakeholders. In product discussions, you might say, "We need to break down barriers between departments to ensure a smooth product launch."

Let's paint a picture. Picture yourself in a meeting. You're sharing your product roadmap, but there's a clear sense of tension in the room. You might say, "We've identified a few barriers that are impacting our alignment on this project. Let's work together to break down these barriers and move forward." 

In another situation, you're trying to escalate an issue to your seniors, but there's resistance. You could say, "To address this issue effectively, we must break down barriers and opt in to receive updates from each other more regularly."

Breaking down barriers is a phrase used both in verbal and written communication, particularly when discussing problems, planning solutions, or making decisions. 

If you're looking for alternatives, consider "overcome obstacles" or "remove roadblocks". These phrases carry the same meaning but might sound more formal, more suited to written communication. If you're in a casual conversation, "get past issues" might be a more relaxed way to express the same idea. 

Remember, the key to breaking down barriers is open, clear communication and the willingness to understand and collaborate.

  <title>Word 155 - Reflection On</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: reflection on. Picture this, you're at the end of a project, you've launched a new product and now, it's time to sit back and think about what went right, what went wrong, and what could have been done differently. That's where our word comes into play. 

"Reflection on" is a phrase we often use in the business world, especially in product management, to discuss looking back on the process, the decisions made, and their outcomes. It's a way of learning from our successes, our mistakes, and the unexpected surprises that came along the way. 

In a product meeting, you might hear a colleague say, "Let's have a reflection on the launch of our new app." What they're asking for is a discussion, a chance to dissect the process to better understand the results. Or in a roadmap discussion, a manager might say, "Before we move on, I'd like us to have a reflection on the last quarter's targets." 

It's a phrase that's used both in spoken and written communication, often in meetings or in emails when we're trying to align with priorities or escalate an issue for deeper understanding.

Now, if you're looking for alternatives to "reflection on", you might consider "review" or "evaluation of". Both of these terms offer a similar meaning but with a slightly different nuance. "Review" is often used when you want to look at the details more critically, while "evaluation of" tends to be used when you're trying to assess the value or effectiveness of something. 

However, remember that "reflection on" has a softer, more thoughtful tone. It invites discussion and learning rather than critical analysis or judgement. It's a phrase that's very much part of the UK business environment, especially where collaboration, learning, and continuous improvement are valued.

So the next time you're wrapping up a project or looking back at a quarter, why not suggest a "reflection on" the process? It promotes open conversation, learning, and improvement, which are all essential in the world of product management.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "session on something". 

When we talk about a "session on something", we're referring to a dedicated period of time where a specific topic is discussed, analyzed, or worked on. Often, you'll hear this phrase in product planning meetings, when teams are deciding features, roadmap, or even resolving issues.

Perhaps you've heard phrases like, "Let's have a session on the new app features," or "We need to schedule a session on the customer feedback." It's quite common when there's a need to align with priorities or escalate an issue that requires a deep-dive discussion.

Let's imagine a scenario. You're a product manager and your team has been receiving mixed feedback on the user interface of your product. You might say to your team, "Let's have a session on the UI feedback next Wednesday, we need to align our thoughts and consider potential improvements." 

Or, if you're discussing the product roadmap with stakeholders, you might suggest, "I propose a session on defining our Q3 priorities. This will help us to stay focused and ensure our roadmap aligns with our business goals."

The term "session on something" is versatile, used in both spoken and written communication. But remember, it's quite informal, so it's more suitable for internal discussions rather than official client communications.

Instead of always using "session on something", you can add some variety with phrases like, "let's dedicate time to discuss...," or "we need a deep-dive into..." These alternatives carry the same essence, allowing a focused discussion on a specific matter. They are also equally at home in most types of communication. Though, "deep-dive" might sound a bit more informal.

So, there you have it! Next time you need to focus on an important product topic, why not suggest a "session on something"? It's a simple and effective way to ensure everyone's on the same page, and it's a phrase that's often used in the UK product management scene.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: 'gather something on something.' Now, that might sound a bit vague to you, but let me assure you, it's a phrase that's as essential as a roadmap to a product manager navigating the business waters in the UK.

So, what do we mean when we say 'gather something on something'? In the product management world, this phrase is used when we need to collect information, data, or feedback on a particular topic or product feature. It's a more conversational way of saying you're conducting research or data collection. For instance, you might gather user feedback on a new app interface, or gather market data on a competitor's product.

Let's put this in context. Imagine you're in a product planning meeting. The team is discussing a new feature rollout, and there's a debate about whether it aligns with customer needs. You might say, 'Let's gather some insights on this feature from our user base before we make a decision.' Or in a stakeholder update, you could report, 'We've gathered substantial data on the issue and are escalating it to the development team.' 

You see how 'gather on' is a handy phrase to have in your arsenal? It's a universal tool, used in both spoken and written communication, but it adds a touch of casualness that helps to ease the otherwise formal business atmosphere.

Now, while 'gather on' is quite common, there are other phrases you can use for a bit of variety. 'Collect information on' is a slightly more formal alternative, typically seen in written documents or official announcements. On the other hand, 'get the lowdown on' is a more informal phrase, mainly used in spoken English and gives a more friendly, approachable tone to your communication.

Remember, while these alternatives have their place, 'gather on' is a trusty standby that fits in just about everywhere. It's like that reliable, go-to tool in your product management toolkit.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: keep an eye out for something. This phrase is more than meets the eye, as it's not about physical vision, but rather about paying close attention to something. Within the bustling world of product management, 'keeping an eye out' is a skill that's as crucial as it is common. It represents our ongoing vigilance for changes, opportunities or challenges that might impact our product or project.

Consider this scenario: you're launching a new feature and you're told to 'keep an eye out for customer feedback'. This means actively monitoring customer responses, possibly by opting in to receive updates from your customer service team or social media channels. You're not just passively waiting; you're actively looking for this information.

Or maybe there's a potential issue brewing within your team, and your manager asks you to 'keep an eye out for any further signs of conflict'. This doesn't mean you're spying on your team, rather, you're staying aware of the team dynamics, ready to escalate an issue if necessary. It's about staying aligned with priorities and ensuring a productive work environment.

Now, is this phrase more for spoken or written communication? Actually, it's both. It's informal and conversational, making it perfect for team meetings or chats, yet it's also clear and professional, so you'll see it in emails and reports too.

So, what are some alternatives? Here are a few: 'watch out for' which also carries an informal tone, 'monitor', a bit more formal and often used in written communication and 'stay vigilant for', which is formal and quite strong, suggesting a serious need for attention.

So, 'keep an eye out for something'. It?s about attention, vigilance, and proactive engagement with whatever you're working on. It's a phrase that shows you're not just doing a job, but actively managing and leading your projects.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: on the radar.

Imagine you're sitting in a war room, tracking enemy movements on a big radar screen. Suddenly, a blip appears. That's something new you need to pay attention to. In a business context, 'on the radar' means something similar. It's a phrase that we use to indicate that we are aware of something and are monitoring or considering it. It's often used in the context of product discussions and strategic planning.

For instance, let's say we're having a meeting to discuss our product roadmap. I might say, 'We've got a potential integration with a major e-commerce platform on the radar.' This means that this integration is something we are aware of and considering, but we haven't yet made a decision or taken action on it. Another example could be, 'We have noticed a spike in customer complaints about our mobile app's speed. We need to put this issue on the radar.' This shows that we've recognized an issue and are prioritizing it for action.

The phrase 'on the radar' is used both in spoken and written communication. It adds a touch of informality to our business language, making it more conversational and less robotic. 

But what if you want to say the same thing in a different way? Well, you could say, 'We have this issue in our sights.' This phrase is more informal and often used in verbal communication. Another alternative is, 'This issue has come to our attention.' This phrase is more formal and is often used in written communication, especially in formal reports or emails.

So, to sum it up, 'on the radar' is a handy phrase to indicate awareness and consideration of a new development or issue. It's used both in spoken and written English and is very common in the world of product management.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: present on something. In the world of product management, to 'present on something' means to explain, share or showcase an idea, a concept, or an update. It's a versatile phrase, often used when we're describing a structured explanation to our colleagues, stakeholders, or clients.

Imagine this scenario. You?ve been working on a new feature for your product. Your team has made significant strides and it's time to share your progress. You?d say, ?I?ll present on the new feature at our next team meeting.? Here, to 'present on' means to informally share your work with your team. 

In another context, you may be meeting your stakeholders. You?ve got exciting updates on the product roadmap that you want to share. To communicate this, you might say, ?Tomorrow, I?ll present on the roadmap updates in the stakeholder meeting.? Here, the phrase takes on a slightly more formal tone, indicating that you'll be giving a structured presentation on the roadmap. 

So, whether it?s an internal team meeting or a high-stakes stakeholder meeting, 'present on' is a phrase you?ll frequently use in both spoken and written communication.

Now, let's talk about some alternatives. You could 'discuss' a topic. This is less formal, and typically used in spoken English to imply a two-way conversation. Another similar phrase is 'share updates on'. It's a casual phrase, often used in emails or team chats to convey the intention of updating others on a topic. Lastly, you could 'elaborate on' a subject. This is a bit more formal and is typically used in written communication, like reports or official emails.

Note that each of these alternatives carries its own tone and formality, so choose the one that best suits your communication context.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: unanimous approval. This phrase is used when everyone involved in a decision agrees with a particular course of action. Imagine you're in a product planning meeting, and the team is discussing whether to push the launch date of a new software update. If everyone agrees that this is the best decision, you could say, "We have unanimous approval to move the launch date."

In daily communication, especially in product planning or decisions, unanimous approval is often used to indicate that every stakeholder is on board with a decision. It's the perfect phrase to use when you want to demonstrate that a decision aligns with everyone's priorities.

Let's look at a practical example. You might be in a roadmap discussion, and after a thorough examination of all factors, everyone agrees on the next big feature to be developed. You could then update other teams or stakeholders by saying, "There was unanimous approval for the development of the new feature during our roadmap discussion."

Unanimous approval is used frequently in both spoken and written communication. You might hear it during a meeting, or see it in an email or a project update.

Of course, there are other ways to communicate the same idea if unanimous approval feels too formal or if you just want to mix it up a little. A more casual phrase might be "everyone was on the same page" or "we all agreed." These phrases are a bit more informal and are typically used more in spoken English. Another alternative could be "universal agreement," which carries the same weight as unanimous approval and is used in both spoken and written contexts.

Remember, 'unanimous approval' is a powerful phrase that communicates the strength of agreement among a group. It's a clear, confident way to convey that a decision has full support and aligns with the team's or company's priorities.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy! Today?s word: tally. Picture this: You're in a product brainstorming session and your team has been throwing out ideas left, right and centre. You need a way to keep track of how many ideas lean towards one direction or another. This is where our word of the day comes in ? tally. 

In the world of product management, 'tally' helps us quantify or count up similar items or suggestions. It's like taking a mental or physical snapshot of where things stand. If you've ever heard someone say, ?Let?s tally up the votes,? they're essentially asking to count and summarise the results. 

It?s a versatile word that you?ll often hear in product discussions, particularly during planning or decision-making meetings. For example, you might hear, "The tally of user feedback suggests we prioritise the app's performance over introducing new features." Or perhaps during a roadmap discussion, "We need to tally our team's capacity with the next quarter's goals."

Remember, 'tally' isn't confined to spoken communication. It's equally at home in written updates too. So, don't hesitate to write in an email to stakeholders, "The tally of our progress aligns with our priorities, and we're on track to meet our targets."

Now, there are a few other words you could use in place of 'tally'. 'Count', 'total', or 'sum' could work, but they lack the nuance of a collective overview that 'tally' provides. Also, 'tally' has a slightly more formal tone, ideal for business settings. 

Another alternative is 'calculate', but that's better used when you're doing more complex number-crunching rather than simply counting up similar items. And while 'calculate' is more common in written English, 'tally' is your go-to word for both spoken and written communication.

So, remember, when you need to keep track of ideas, preferences, or any other countable items in your product discussions, 'tally' is your word. It's succinct, professional, and clearly communicates the act of summarising countable data.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: oppose. Now, if you're thinking of two armies clashing on a battlefield, you're not entirely wrong, but in a business context, to oppose means to disagree with or resist a proposition or plan. It's often used in product discussions when there's a conflict of opinions, or during planning stages when differing strategies are being considered.

For instance, you might hear it in a sentence like, "I oppose the idea of launching the new product in Q1 without adequate market research." Oppose here signifies disagreement with a particular plan of action. It's not confrontational, it's just the expression of a different point of view. Remember, in a healthy business environment, opposition is often a source of constructive dialogue and can lead to better decision making. 

Another common phrase is "to be opposed to something." This means you have a strong disagreement or aversion towards an idea. For example, in a stakeholder update, a product manager might say, "Our key stakeholders are opposed to increasing the product price at this stage."

Now, the word 'oppose' is versatile; it's used in both spoken and written communication. It's formal enough for written reports, yet natural in everyday speech. 

If you want to mix it up a bit, you could use alternatives like 'object to' or 'disagree with'. 'Object to' is a bit more formal, more commonly found in written communication, and implies a significant degree of conflict. 'Disagree with', on the other hand, is less formal and more commonly used in everyday spoken English. 

So, whether you're voicing your opinion in a meeting or jotting down your thoughts for a report, remember the word 'oppose' and its alternatives. They're simple yet powerful tools to express disagreement and stimulate discussion.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: "take a vote on". Picture yourself in a meeting room, surrounded by your product team, discussing the next step in your project roadmap. The air is buzzing with ideas and possibilities, but the team is divided. How do you resolve this? One way is to "take a vote on" the issue at hand.

To "take a vote on" something essentially means to have a formal decision-making process, whereby each team member expresses their preference through a vote. In product management, this is a common approach to reach a mutual agreement on critical product decisions, align with priorities, and ensure everyone is on the same page.

Let's dive into a couple of examples. Imagine your team is split on whether to prioritize a user-friendly interface or additional features for your new app. To settle this, you could say, "Let's take a vote on whether we should focus more on the user interface or add more features." 

In another scenario, you may be in a stakeholders' meeting, discussing whether to escalate an issue. Here, you might propose, "I think we should take a vote on whether to escalate this issue to the CEO or handle it internally."

In these examples, "take a vote on" is used to make democratic decisions, bringing transparency and collaboration into the fold. It's a phrase you'll hear in both spoken and written communication, be it in meetings, emails, or project documentation.

Now, let's explore some alternatives. Instead of "take a vote on", you could use "poll the team on", which carries a less formal tone and is more common in spoken English. Another alternative is "call for a vote on", a slightly more formal choice, often used in written communication.

Remember, the key here is to foster a culture of open dialogue and shared decision-making. Using phrases like "take a vote on" encourages collective ownership, keeping everyone invested in the product's success.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: angle. 

When you think of the word 'angle', you might initially think of it in a geometric sense, but in the world of product management, it takes on a more nuanced meaning. In our context, 'angle' is often used to describe a specific approach or perspective towards a problem or decision. It's like looking at a situation or a product from a unique viewpoint to gain fresh insights, or to devise innovative strategies.

Imagine you're in a product meeting. Someone might say, "Let's consider this from a different angle." This means, let's change our perspective, think differently, or explore another approach. In product roadmap discussions, you might hear, "Our angle for this quarter is user experience enhancement." This signals the main focus or approach for the time frame.

'Angle' is a versatile word. You can 'take an angle', 'consider a different angle', or even 'align your angle with company priorities'. It's commonly used in both spoken and written communication, making it a valuable addition to your vocabulary arsenal.

Now, let's look at some alternatives. 'Perspective' is a synonym, but it's often used in a more formal context, and is more commonly seen in written communication. 'Approach', on the other hand, is less formal and more common in everyday spoken English. 'Standpoint' is another alternative, it's a bit formal and often used when discussing opinions or viewpoints on more complex issues.

Remember, 'angle' is all about perspective and approach. It's about looking at things differently, innovating, and aligning with priorities. It's a word that's very much at home in the world of product management and one that can give your communication that extra edge.

Imagine you're in a meeting about the upcoming product launch, and one team member starts discussing an unrelated issue about office supplies. You might gently remind them to 'stay on topic', and steer the conversation back to the product launch. In a written context, if an email thread begins to drift off course, you may opt in to send a polite reminder for everyone to 'stay on topic'.

Often used with phrases like 'align with priorities', it's a polite way to ensure that the team's attention and resources are not diverted away. For instance, during a roadmap discussion, if a debate arises about a feature not due for several quarters, you might say, 'While that's an important issue, let's stay on topic and focus on the priorities for this quarter.'

'Stay on topic' is used in both spoken and written communication, and it's a versatile phrase that helps keep conversations and communications streamlined and productive.

For a bit of variety, you can also use phrases like 'stick to the subject', which has a similar tone and is equally common in both spoken and written English. Another alternative is 'keep on track', which adds a bit of formality, and is often used in written communications or more formal meetings.

Remember, the goal is not to stifle creativity or sideline concerns but to manage time and resources effectively, which is crucial in any fast-paced UK business environment.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: stay on schedule. To 'stay on schedule' is a phrase we often use in the dynamic world of product management. It means to keep the tasks, activities, or projects moving according to the planned timeline, ensuring that everything is on track without delays.

In our day-to-day communication, especially in product discussions or planning, the term 'stay on schedule' is a common phrase. For example, in a meeting about a product launch, you might hear, "We need to stay on schedule to ensure the product hits the market as planned." Or during a roadmap discussion, a team member might say, "Let's align with our priorities and stay on schedule." 

'Stay on schedule' is also often used in the context of escalating an issue. If a problem arises that threatens to delay a project, a product manager might say, "We need to resolve this quickly to stay on schedule."

This phrase is used in both spoken and written communication, but it's especially prevalent in written updates or reports to stakeholders, where maintaining timelines is critical. 

Now, let's explore some natural alternatives for 'stay on schedule.' One could be 'keep to the timeline.' This phrase is slightly more formal and often used in written communication. Another alternative is 'stick to the plan', which is more casual and commonly used in spoken English.

Remember, 'stay on schedule' is about maintaining momentum and ensuring things progress as planned. It?s a key phrase in the product management vocabulary, keeping everyone aligned and focused on the same goals.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: periodically. 

Picture this: You're in a product planning meeting and your colleague says, "We should periodically review our product's performance metrics." Here, periodically means at regular or intermittent times. It?s a handy word to express recurrence without specifying an exact timeframe. You may use it to discuss tasks that don?t need daily attention, but do require regular check-ins - perfect for product discussions or planning.

Take this situation: Let?s say you're a product manager of a tech firm. You might want to say: "To ensure our app's functionality, we should periodically run tests and fix any bugs." It signifies an ongoing commitment, but leaves room for flexibility.

Or perhaps you're in a meeting and someone suggests: "We should align with stakeholders periodically to update on the product roadmap." This could mean monthly, quarterly or even annually, depending on the context.

Periodically is versatile. It?s used in both spoken and written communication, often when setting up recurring meetings, updates, or checks. It?s a bit formal, but not stuffy or old-fashioned. It fits right into the dynamic pace of product management.

Looking for alternatives? Try occasionally or from time to time. Occasionally is less formal, more suited to spoken English. It's great for casual check-ins or updates. On the other hand, from time to time, is a tad more formal. Ideal for written reports, stakeholder updates, or memos.

In a nutshell, periodically is your go-to word when you want to convey regularity without pinning down to a specific schedule. It's a staple in the product management vocabulary, helping you sound more confident and proficient in your business communications.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: split. Picture this: You're in a team meeting discussing a new product feature. The team seems divided, or "split," on the best way forward. In this sense, "split" refers to a division or separation, often in terms of opinions or choices.

While we usually think of "split" physically as breaking apart, in a business context, it's often used to describe decisions, perspectives, or even resources. So, if you hear the phrase "we're split on this issue," it means there's no clear consensus. In the product management world, you might also come across phrases like "split testing," which is a method for comparing two versions of a webpage or product to see which one performs better.

Let's dive into some real-life examples. You could hear a product manager in a meeting saying, "Our team is split between adding more features to the existing product and creating a new product line." Another instance might be during a roadmap discussion, where you might say, "We need to split our resources between the two main projects."

And, of course, "split" isn't just for spoken communication. You'll see it written in emails, reports, and project plans.

Now, as diverse as English is, there are always alternatives for words. Instead of "split", you might use "divided" or "separated". These words are slightly more formal, and while "divided" is used equally in spoken and written English, "separated" is more commonly used in writing. Remember though, the nuances of these words might change depending on the context, so keep your ears open!

English is a rich language, and the word "split" is a perfect example of how one word can encapsulate different contexts, emotions, and meanings, especially in the dynamic world of product management.

  <title>Word 170 - Set In Stone</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word is "set in stone." 

Imagine you're in a meeting, discussing the launch of a new product. You've done your market research, mapped out the roadmap, and set the deadlines. You confidently tell your team, "These plans are not set in stone. We can always pivot if we need to." Here, "set in stone" is a metaphorical phrase meaning something is fixed, unchangeable, or permanent. It's often used in business discussions when we talk about plans, strategies, or decisions that are still open to changes or adjustments. 

Suppose you?ve received a stakeholder's email asking if the product features are final. You could respond by saying, "While we have a strong roadmap, it?s not set in stone. We're open to feedback and improvements." This phrase is used to ensure everyone understands that while a plan is in place, there's still room for flexibility. 

A typical collocation you might hear is "our strategy isn't set in stone." This indicates that while the strategy is in place, it can be tweaked or aligned with shifting priorities. Another might be "the deadline isn't set in stone," implying that the date could change if circumstances dictate.

Now, "set in stone" can be used both in spoken and written communication. However, it tends to appear more often in spoken English, particularly in meetings or discussions. 

A few alternatives to "set in stone" include "written in pencil" or "up in the air." Both of these phrases convey the idea of flexibility or changeability. "Written in pencil" is less formal than "set in stone," and is typically used in casual settings or among colleagues. Meanwhile, "up in the air" implies a higher degree of uncertainty and is frequently used in both spoken and written English.

So, remember, the next time you want to convey the flexibility of your product plans or strategies, you could say they are not "set in stone." You're essentially letting your team or stakeholders know that while you have a plan, you're open to changes that could potentially make the product even better.

  <title>Word 171 - Left Off</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: left off.

Picture this: You're in a product strategy meeting and someone says, "Let's pick up where we left off last week." In this context, "left off" means to restart an activity or conversation from the point where it was previously halted or paused. It's often used in product discussions and planning, especially when you're working on a long-term project that spans across multiple meetings.

For instance, you might hear it in a sentence like, "Before we start, can anyone remind us where we left off with the Q4 roadmap?" This implies the speaker wants to continue the discussion from the last known point. It?s a phrase that invites participants to align their priorities and continue working towards a shared goal.

Another example might be during a stakeholder update. If your team has been working on resolving a critical issue and you're giving an update to stakeholders, you might say, "To pick up where we left off, we've escalated the issue and are working closely with the engineering team." Here, "left off" is used to resume the discussion on a previously shared topic, keeping everyone informed and on the same page.

"Left off" is used both in spoken and written communication, making it a versatile phrase in the English language. However, it?s important to remember that "left off" is quite informal, so it?s typically used in casual conversations or internal communications.

If you're looking for alternatives, consider "resume" or "continue from". Both are a little more formal and often used in written communication. For instance, in an email, you might write, "Let's resume our discussion on the product launch." Or, "We'll continue from where we stopped in our next meeting."

Always remember, the goal is clear and effective communication. Feel free to use "left off" or its alternatives as fits the context and tone of your conversation.

  <title>Word 172 - Reconvene</title>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">"Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today?s word: reconvene. 

In the bustling world of product management, we often find ourselves in meetings that need to be... well, let's say, put on hold. Maybe we need more data, or perhaps we're waiting for a stakeholder's input. And that's when we use the term 'reconvene'. 

So, what does 'reconvene' mean? In a nutshell, it means to meet again, usually at a later date or time. Imagine you're in a product planning meeting and there's a critical decision that can't be made because the head of marketing isn't present. You might say, 'Let's reconvene when we have Jane from marketing onboard.' 

A common phrase we use with 'reconvene' is 'reconvene at a later date or time'. For example, in product roadmap discussions, you might say, 'We're lacking some key user insights, let's reconvene at a later time when we have more data.' 

'Reconvene' isn't just a fancy word we use in spoken communication. In written communication, especially in emails, you might say, 'We'll reconvene after the team has had a chance to review the updated product specifications.' 

Now, sometimes 'reconvene' might feel too formal, especially in a chat with your team. In such cases, you can use more casual phrases like 'meet again', 'get back together' or 'catch up later'. But remember, these alternatives are more suited to spoken English and might not convey the same seriousness or formality as 'reconvene' in written communication. 

So, the next time you need to hit pause on a meeting or a discussion but also signal that it's important to get back to it, remember to use 'reconvene'. It's a simple, yet powerful word that can help ensure your product discussions, planning, or decisions don't lose momentum.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: persist. Persist is a word you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially when talking about challenges or long-term goals. It means to continue doing something despite difficulties, to keep going even when it?s tough. Imagine you?re presenting a product roadmap, and stakeholders push back on your timeline. You might need to persist with your plan, explaining why it?s the right approach. Or perhaps a technical issue keeps delaying your launch, but your team decides to persist, working late to fix it. Common collocations include persist with an idea, persist in your efforts, or persist despite obstacles. You can use persist in both spoken and written contexts, like in emails saying, We need to persist with this strategy, or in meetings saying, Let?s persist and see this through. Alternatives include continue, which is more neutral, or persevere, which sounds more determined. Stick with it is another option, but it?s more informal, better for chats with colleagues. Remember, persist is about not giving up, about pushing forward when things are hard. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: middle ground. Middle ground is that sweet spot where two sides find agreement, especially when they start with different opinions. Picture this: in product roadmap discussions, engineering wants more time for tech debt, while marketing pushes for new features. The middle ground might be dedicating some sprints to each. Or imagine stakeholder meetings where one team wants a bold redesign and another prefers minor tweaks. Finding middle ground could mean updating key elements without a full overhaul. You?ll often hear phrases like reach a middle ground or strike a middle ground in these conversations. It works equally well in spoken and written contexts, whether you?re emailing a compromise proposal or suggesting it in a meeting. If middle ground feels too formal, try alternatives like compromise, which is neutral, or meet halfway, which sounds more casual. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: I see where you are coming from. This is a really useful phrase in UK workplaces when you want to show someone you understand their perspective, especially when discussing product roadmaps or stakeholder feedback. It?s a polite way to acknowledge their point before adding your own thoughts. For example, if a colleague suggests delaying a feature launch to focus on quality, you might say, I see where you are coming from, quality is crucial, but let?s also consider the impact on our timeline. Or in a stakeholder meeting, if someone argues for more user testing, you could say, I see where you are coming from, testing is important, though we need to balance it with the release schedule. Common collocations include phrases like I see where you are coming from, but or I see where you are coming from, and. This phrase works best in spoken conversations, though you might use it in informal written chats too. If you want alternatives, you could say That?s a fair point, which is slightly more neutral, or I understand your perspective, which feels a bit more formal. Thanks for listening.

You might say, I?m having trouble following the timeline changes, could we go over them again? Or perhaps you?re working on a report and the data isn?t making sense. You could tell your colleague, I?m having trouble analysing these figures, do you have any insights? Notice how natural it sounds ? it?s polite, it?s clear, and it gets you the help you need. You?ll often hear it with verbs like understanding, completing, or accessing, as in having trouble understanding the brief or having trouble accessing the system. This phrase works well both in spoken and written communication, whether you?re in a meeting, writing an email, or chatting with your team.

A capstone is that final, important piece that completes a project or a phase of work, the thing that ties everything together and makes it feel finished. Think of it like the top stone on a pyramid, the one that holds everything in place. In product management, you might talk about a capstone feature, the one that makes your product truly stand out, or a capstone presentation that wraps up months of hard work for stakeholders. For example, you could say, This new AI integration is the capstone of our Q3 roadmap, it?s what makes all the other features shine. Or in a meeting, you might hear, Let?s treat the upcoming demo as our capstone moment, the chance to show the full value of this project. Common collocations include capstone project, capstone achievement, or capstone deliverable. You?ll use capstone in both spoken and written contexts, especially when discussing milestones or final outputs.

Now, if you're a product manager, you know that feedback is constant, and sometimes that feedback means you need to adjust your plans. When we say something requires changes, it means it needs adjustments or modifications to meet expectations or standards. Think about product roadmaps?stakeholders might review your timeline and say the launch schedule requires changes to align with new business priorities. Or in a sprint retrospective, your team might note that the current workflow requires changes to improve efficiency. The phrase is neutral but firm, making it perfect for professional discussions. You?ll often hear it with words like feedback, design, process, or approach?for example, the client feedback requires changes to the prototype, or the compliance review requires changes to our data handling process. It works equally well in spoken and written contexts, from emails to meetings. If you want alternatives, consider needs adjustments, which is slightly softer, or must be revised, which feels more urgent.

Now, whereas is a handy word for showing contrast in a professional way, especially when you?re comparing ideas or situations in the workplace. Imagine you?re discussing product roadmaps with your team. You might say, our current version focuses on basic features, whereas the next release will include advanced analytics. Or in a stakeholder meeting, you could explain, the marketing team prefers a broad campaign, whereas the sales team wants targeted outreach. Notice how whereas helps you highlight differences clearly and politely. It?s perfect for both spoken and written contexts, like emails, reports, or presentations. Common collocations include whereas in contrast or whereas on the other hand, but you can use it alone too. If you want alternatives, try while or although, but remember whereas is more formal and precise, while while is more conversational, and although often introduces a slight contradiction.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: adjustment. Now, adjustment is one of those words you?ll hear all the time in UK workplaces, especially in product management. It simply means a small change to make something work better. Think about product roadmaps?when timelines shift, you might say we need to make an adjustment to the launch date. Or in stakeholder meetings, if feedback comes in late, you could talk about making adjustments to the project plan. The key is that adjustment suggests a minor, practical change, not a complete overhaul. You?ll often hear it paired with words like minor adjustment, slight adjustment, or even market adjustment when talking about pricing. For example, in a stand-up meeting, you might say, after reviewing the data, we?ve made a slight adjustment to the feature prioritisation. Or in an email, you could write, please review the budget adjustments before the next meeting. It works equally well in spoken and written contexts?just keep it natural. If you want alternatives, consider tweak for something even smaller and more informal, or modification for a slightly more formal or technical tone. Remember, adjustment is your go-to for those everyday changes that keep things running smoothly. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: lump sum. A lump sum is a single payment made all at once, rather than in smaller amounts over time. In product management, you might discuss a lump sum when talking about budgets, contracts, or payments. For example, if your team receives funding for a project, you could say, We got approval for a lump sum to develop the new feature, so we can allocate it all upfront. Or in a stakeholder meeting, you might explain, The vendor prefers a lump sum payment instead of monthly instalments. Common collocations include receive a lump sum, pay a lump sum, or offer a lump sum. You?ll use this term in both spoken and written contexts, like emails, reports, or negotiations. If you need alternatives, consider one-time payment, which is more neutral, or upfront payment, which emphasises timing. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: uncertainties around. This phrase is all about those unclear or unpredictable aspects of a situation, especially in product management and business discussions. You might hear it when talking about product roadmaps, stakeholder expectations, or market conditions. For example, if your team is planning a new feature launch but there are unknowns about customer demand or technical challenges, you could say, we need to address the uncertainties around customer adoption before finalising the timeline. Or in a stakeholder meeting, you might explain, there are still some uncertainties around the budget approval, so we?ll update the plan next week. Common collocations include uncertainties around timelines, uncertainties around requirements, and uncertainties around market trends. You can use this phrase in both spoken and written contexts?it works well in emails, presentations, and casual conversations. If you want alternatives, consider using questions around for a softer tone, or lack of clarity on for a more formal feel. Remember, uncertainties around is a natural way to express doubt or unpredictability without sounding too negative. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: roll out. Now, if you're a product manager, you'll hear roll out all the time?it's about introducing something new, like a feature or a process, in stages. Picture this: you're in a stakeholder meeting, and someone says, we plan to roll out the updated dashboard next quarter. That means they'll launch it gradually, maybe team by team or region by region. Roll out is perfect for product roadmaps because it suggests control and planning. You might also say, the IT team rolled out the new security policy last month, meaning they implemented it step by step. Common collocations? Think roll out a plan, roll out a system, or roll out a campaign. You?ll use roll out both spoken and written?emails, presentations, casual chats. If you need alternatives, consider launch, which feels bigger and more public, or implement, which is more formal and technical. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

You?ll use rebate in both spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations. If rebate feels too formal, you could say refund, which is more general, or discount, which is applied upfront rather than after purchase.

This is a really handy phrase to use when you want to let someone know you?ll update them later, especially in fast-moving workplaces like product management.

When you get the green light from someone, it means you receive their approval or permission to move forward with something. This phrase is super common in UK workplaces, especially when discussing projects, product roadmaps, or stakeholder decisions.

You?ll hear it in meetings, like, We await the final budget figures to proceed, or in emails, like, I await your feedback by Friday. Common collocations include await approval, await confirmation, and await further instructions. It works in both spoken and written English, though it?s slightly more common in writing.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: novice. A novice is someone who is new to a skill or job, someone who?s just starting out and still learning the ropes. In product management, you might be a novice when you first join a team, or when you?re working with a new tool or framework. For example, if you?re new to creating product roadmaps, you could say, I?m still a novice at roadmap planning, so I?d appreciate any guidance. Or in a stakeholder meeting, you might hear, Let?s remember some of us are novices when it comes to this software, so we?ll need a proper training session. Novice often pairs with words like complete novice, absolute novice, or novice level, and it works well in both spoken and written contexts. If you want alternatives, you could say beginner, which is more general, or newcomer, which focuses more on being new to a team or company rather than a skill.

Craft works well in both spoken and written contexts, whether you?re discussing strategy, emails, or presentations. Common collocations include craft a strategy, craft a narrative, or craft a solution. For example, you might say, let?s craft a clearer user story for the dev team, or our marketing team crafted a brilliant campaign last quarter. If you?re looking for alternatives, consider shape?it?s similar but less nuanced, or develop?which is more neutral and technical. Build could also work, though it feels more structural.

Human oversight means having people review or monitor decisions, especially when automation or technology is involved. In product management, human oversight is crucial.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: upend. Now, upend is a fantastic word for describing situations where something is completely changed or turned upside down, especially in unexpected ways. Think about product roadmaps or stakeholder meetings where new data or feedback suddenly upends your plans. For example, imagine you?re about to launch a feature, but user testing reveals a major flaw. That discovery could upend your entire timeline, forcing you to rethink priorities. Or picture a stakeholder meeting where a senior leader upends the discussion by introducing a completely new strategy. In both cases, upend means a sudden, dramatic shift. You?ll often hear it in collocations like upend expectations, upend the market, or upend traditional approaches. It works equally well in spoken and written contexts, whether you?re in a casual team huddle or drafting a formal email. If upend feels too strong, consider alternatives like disrupt, which is similar but often used in tech contexts, or overturn, which has a more formal tone, like overturning a decision.

Intuitive is a word you?ll hear often in product management, especially when discussing user experience or design. It means something is easy to understand or use without needing much explanation. Think about a product roadmap or a dashboard?if it?s intuitive, your stakeholders can grasp it quickly, no lengthy training required. For example, you might say, we need this feature to feel intuitive for first-time users, or the new interface isn?t as intuitive as we hoped, let?s simplify it. Common collocations include intuitive design, intuitive navigation, and intuitively obvious. You can use intuitive in both spoken and written contexts, like meetings, emails, or reports. If you?re looking for alternatives, consider user-friendly, which is similar but more casual, or straightforward, which is neutral and works well in technical discussions. Another option is self-explanatory, but that?s more formal and best for written communication. Remember, intuitive is about that effortless understanding?so use it when you want to highlight ease and clarity. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: some principle hold timeless. This phrase means that certain core ideas or rules stay relevant no matter how much time passes or how things change around them. In product management, some principle hold timeless when we talk about user-centric design or clear communication?these are basics that never go out of style. Imagine you?re in a stakeholder meeting debating whether to cut corners on research to speed up a launch. You might say, let?s remember some principle hold timeless, like understanding our users before building. Or when reviewing a roadmap, you could point out that while trends come and go, some principle hold timeless, such as aligning features with business goals. You?ll often hear this phrase paired with words like fundamentals, enduring, or unchanged?common collocations that reinforce the idea. It works well in both spoken and written contexts, especially when you need to remind others of long-term values. If you want alternatives, try certain truths remain constant for a more formal tone, or some things never change for a casual chat. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: divergent. Divergent is a word you?ll often hear in UK workplaces when discussing ideas, opinions, or strategies that move in different directions. Imagine you?re in a product roadmap meeting, and your team has two very different approaches to solving a problem. One group wants to focus on innovation, while another prefers improving existing features. You might say, our ideas are quite divergent here, let?s explore both paths. Or perhaps in a stakeholder meeting, someone points out that the marketing and engineering teams have divergent priorities, meaning their goals aren?t aligned. Common collocations include divergent views, divergent thinking, and divergent paths. You can use divergent in both spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations, to describe situations where things split apart or differ significantly. If divergent feels too formal, try alternatives like differing, which is neutral and works in most situations, or conflicting, which has a stronger tone and suggests tension. Another option is contrasting, which highlights differences without implying disagreement. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: convergent. In the UK workplace, convergent is a word you?ll often hear when teams are aligning ideas or narrowing down options. Think of product roadmaps or stakeholder meetings where different opinions start coming together towards a single solution. For example, during a product prioritisation discussion, you might say, After hours of debate, our ideas became more convergent, and we agreed on the top three features. Or in a project update, you could note, The team?s feedback was surprisingly convergent this time, so we?re moving forward quickly. Common collocations include convergent thinking, convergent opinions, and convergent goals. You?ll use this word both in spoken and written contexts, like meetings, emails, or reports. If convergent feels too formal, try alternatives like aligned, which is more casual but similar in meaning, or in agreement, which works well in collaborative settings. Just remember, convergent often implies a process of narrowing down, not just simple agreement. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: complex. Now, complex is a word you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially when discussing projects, products, or problems that have many layers or aren?t straightforward. For example, when talking about a product roadmap, you might say this integration is complex because it involves multiple systems working together. Or in a stakeholder meeting, you could explain that the feedback is complex, meaning it?s not just one simple issue but a mix of technical and user experience challenges. Notice how complex often pairs with words like issue, problem, situation, or system ? these are common collocations. You can use complex in both spoken and written contexts, whether you?re emailing a colleague or presenting in a meeting. For instance, you might write, the client?s requirements are complex, so we?ll need more time to analyse them. Or in a conversation, you could say, let?s break down this complex task into smaller steps. If you want alternatives, consider using complicated, which is similar but sometimes feels more negative, or intricate, which suggests detailed and finely woven parts, or multifaceted, which emphasises many different aspects. Just remember, complex is neutral and professional, so it?s a safe choice in most situations. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: Underscore. Now, underscore is a word you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially when someone wants to highlight or emphasise a key point. Imagine you?re in a product roadmap meeting, and you need to stress why a particular feature is critical. You might say, let me underscore the importance of user feedback in this decision. Or perhaps in a stakeholder update, you could say, the data underscores the need for faster delivery times. See how it?s used to draw attention to something really important? Underscore often pairs with words like importance, need, or value, and it works well in both spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations. If you?re looking for alternatives, you could say highlight or emphasise, but underscore has a slightly stronger, more formal tone, perfect for when you really want to drive a point home.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: laborious process. A laborious process is something that takes a lot of time and effort, often feeling slow or tedious. In product management, you might describe compiling detailed reports or aligning multiple stakeholders as a laborious process because it involves many steps and requires patience. For example, during a product roadmap meeting, you could say, finalising the timeline was a laborious process due to conflicting priorities across teams. Or in an email update, you might write, the data migration has been a laborious process, but we?re making steady progress. Common collocations include laborious process of, laborious but necessary, or laborious yet rewarding. You can use this phrase both in spoken and written contexts, especially when explaining delays or justifying time spent. If you want alternatives, consider time-consuming, which is more neutral, or painstaking, which implies extra care. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: bespoke. Now, bespoke is a word you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially when talking about custom solutions or tailored approaches. Imagine you?re in a product roadmap meeting and someone says, we need a bespoke solution for this client?it means something made specifically for their needs, not off-the-shelf. Or in stakeholder meetings, you might hear, let?s create a bespoke report for the board?again, tailored, not generic. The word pops up in both spoken and written contexts, often paired with words like solution, service, or approach?think bespoke software, bespoke training, bespoke design. For example, you could say, our team developed a bespoke dashboard to track these metrics, or the consultancy offered a bespoke strategy for our market entry. If bespoke feels too formal, you could say custom-made or tailored?custom-made leans practical, while tailored feels a bit more polished.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: magnitude. Now, magnitude is a word we use to talk about the size or importance of something, especially when it?s big or significant. In product management, you might talk about the magnitude of a project?s impact or the magnitude of a problem you?re trying to solve. For example, in a stakeholder meeting, you could say, We need to consider the magnitude of this delay on our product roadmap?it?s not just a small setback, it could affect the entire quarter. Or when discussing priorities, you might say, The magnitude of this bug is high because it impacts all our users, not just a few. Common collocations include understand the magnitude, grasp the magnitude, or appreciate the magnitude?all ways to highlight how big or important something is. You?ll use magnitude in both spoken and written contexts, like emails, reports, or presentations. If you?re looking for alternatives, consider scale when talking about size, or significance when focusing on importance?scale is more neutral, while significance often carries a bit more weight.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: just to flag. Just to flag is a really handy phrase in UK workplaces, especially for product managers. It?s a polite way to point something out, to draw attention to an issue or detail without sounding too forceful. Imagine you?re in a stakeholder meeting discussing the product roadmap, and you notice a potential delay in the timeline. You might say, I just wanted to flag that the design phase might take longer than expected. Or in an email, you could write, Just to flag, the analytics team needs more data before the next sprint. It?s a soft but effective way to highlight something important. You?ll often hear it with words like concern, issue, or update, like just to flag a concern or just to flag an update. It works well in both spoken and written contexts, making it super versatile. If you want alternatives, you could say just to highlight, which is a bit more direct, or just to mention, which is even lighter. Both keep the tone professional but adjust the emphasis slightly.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: consist of. If you're a product manager, you'll often need to describe what something is made up of, and that's where consist of comes in. It's a natural way to break down components, whether you're explaining a product roadmap or outlining features in a stakeholder meeting. For example, you might say our Q3 roadmap consists of three key initiatives: user research, feature updates, and performance improvements. Or in a sprint planning meeting, you could mention this sprint consists of bug fixes and UI refinements. Notice how consist of helps you list parts clearly and professionally. Common collocations include teams consist of, the process consists of, or the package consists of. You can use it both in spoken and written contexts, from emails to presentations. If you want alternatives, try made up of for a slightly more casual tone, or comprises for a more formal touch, though be careful with comprises as it?s less common in everyday speech. Remember, consist of is your go-to for breaking things down smoothly. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: constitute. Now, constitute is a word you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially when discussing what makes up or forms something important. Think about product roadmaps or stakeholder meetings where you need to explain what components create the whole. For example, you might say these three features constitute the core functionality of our product, meaning they form the essential parts. Or in a meeting, you could highlight that customer feedback and market research constitute the basis for our new strategy, showing they are the foundation. Notice how constitute is often used with words like core, basis, or part to describe what something is made of. You can use it both in spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations, when you want to sound precise and professional. If you?re looking for alternatives, consider words like form or comprise, but remember form is more general, while comprise is a bit more formal. So next time you?re explaining what makes up your project or plan, try using constitute to sound clear and confident. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: compliance with. Compliance with is a phrase you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially when discussing rules, standards, or regulations. It simply means following or adhering to something, like a policy or a guideline. For product managers, compliance with is crucial when aligning your product roadmap with legal requirements or company standards. Imagine you?re in a stakeholder meeting and someone asks, are we in compliance with the new data protection laws? This means they?re checking if your product meets those legal rules. Another example: your team might say, we need to ensure compliance with the accessibility guidelines before launch. Here, compliance with highlights the need to follow specific design standards. You?ll often hear it paired with words like regulations, standards, or policies, such as compliance with industry standards or compliance with company policies. This phrase works well in both spoken and written contexts, whether you?re emailing a colleague or presenting in a meeting. If you want alternatives, consider aligned with, which sounds a bit softer, or meets, which is more direct but less formal. For example, our product is aligned with GDPR requirements or our design meets accessibility guidelines. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: damage to something. Now, when we talk about damage to something in the workplace, we mean harm or negative effects on a project, a relationship, or even a product. For example, if you delay a product launch without warning, that could cause serious damage to stakeholder trust. Or if you rush a feature without proper testing, you might do damage to the product's reputation. Notice how we often use damage to something when discussing consequences, especially in product roadmaps or stakeholder meetings. It?s a phrase that helps you highlight risks or unintended outcomes. You might hear someone say, We need to avoid any damage to the client relationship, so let?s communicate the delays clearly. Or, The last-minute changes could cause damage to the project timeline, so we should reassess. Common collocations include damage to reputation, damage to trust, or damage to progress. You can use this phrase both in spoken and written contexts, like emails or meetings. If you want alternatives, consider harm to something, which is similar but slightly softer, or negative impact on something, which feels more formal and measured.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: hear back. When we say hear back in the workplace, it simply means getting a response or feedback from someone, usually after you?ve asked a question or sent a request. It?s a very natural way to talk about waiting for updates, especially in product management. Imagine you?ve shared a product roadmap with stakeholders and you?re waiting for their input. You might say, I?ll let you know once I hear back from the design team. Or perhaps you?ve emailed a colleague about a deadline and you?re following up. You could ask, Have you heard back from the client yet? It?s a phrase you?ll use often in both spoken and written English, like in meetings or quick Slack messages. Common collocations include hear back from someone, hear back about something, or just hear back soon. If you want alternatives, you could say get a response, which is a bit more formal, or receive feedback, which is more specific. A casual option is get back to you, like I?ll get back to you by Friday. Remember, hear back is your go-to for everyday situations where you?re waiting for that reply. Thanks for listening.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: be perceived to. This phrase is all about how others see or interpret something, especially in the workplace. It?s not just about what is true, but how it looks or feels to others. For example, if you delay a product launch, it might be perceived to mean the team isn?t prepared, even if the delay is for good reasons. Or in stakeholder meetings, your silence could be perceived to show disinterest, when really you?re just thinking deeply. The key is to be aware of how actions, decisions, or even your tone might be perceived to avoid misunderstandings. Common collocations include be perceived to be, be perceived to have, or be perceived to mean. You might say, the new feature was perceived to be too complex, so we simplified the design. Or, the manager?s feedback was perceived to have a negative tone, though it was meant constructively. This phrase works well in both spoken and written contexts, like emails, reports, or discussions. If you want alternatives, consider seem to be or appear to be, which are slightly softer, or come across as, which is more casual. Remember, being mindful of how things are perceived to can make all the difference in clear communication. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: nudge. In UK workplaces, to nudge means to gently push someone to take action or remind them about something, without being too direct or forceful. It?s a soft way to keep things moving, especially when you?re dealing with busy colleagues or stakeholders. For example, if a deadline is approaching and you need feedback on a product roadmap, you might say, I?ll just nudge the design team to send their updates, or in a stakeholder meeting, you could mention, Let?s nudge the discussion back to the budget priorities. Nudge works well in both spoken and written contexts, like emails or casual chats, and it often pairs with words like gentle, friendly, or quick ? think a quick nudge or a friendly nudge. If nudge feels too subtle, you might try prompt, which is slightly more formal, or remind, which is more neutral but still polite. Just avoid push, which can sound too aggressive unless you really need to be firm. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: multi faceted. When we say something is multi faceted, we mean it has many different aspects or layers, especially in complex situations. In product management, this word is perfect for describing things like product roadmaps or stakeholder needs because they often involve multiple dimensions. For example, you might say our product strategy is multi faceted because it addresses user experience, technical feasibility, and business goals all at once. Or in a stakeholder meeting, you could explain that feedback from customers is multi faceted, covering pricing, features, and support. Notice how multi faceted naturally pairs with words like approach, challenge, or role, as in a multi faceted approach to problem-solving or a multi faceted role in the team. You can use this word both in spoken and written contexts, whether you?re presenting in a meeting or writing a project update. If you need alternatives, consider complex or multi dimensional, but remember complex can sound more technical, while multi dimensional feels slightly more abstract. Thanks for listening.

To compile means to gather things together, to collect information or data and put it into one place. Think about when you need to compile a product roadmap?you?re pulling in features, timelines, and priorities from different teams into one clear document. Or imagine compiling feedback from stakeholders after a meeting, taking all their comments and organising them into a single report. It?s about bringing scattered pieces together. You might say, I?ll compile the user research findings by Friday, or we need to compile a list of bug fixes before the next sprint. Common collocations include compile data, compile a report, compile feedback, and compile results. You?ll use compile both in writing, like emails or documents, and in speaking, like meetings or quick updates. If you want alternatives, consider gather?more casual, good for quick chats?or consolidate, which sounds more formal, like when merging complex data.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: extrapolate. Now, extrapolate is a word you?ll hear often in product management, especially when talking about data or trends. It means to take what you know now and use it to predict or estimate something in the future. Imagine you?re in a stakeholder meeting discussing your product roadmap. You might say, based on our current user growth, we can extrapolate that demand will double by next year. Or perhaps you?re analysing quarterly sales data and need to extrapolate those figures to forecast annual revenue. It?s a handy word for making informed guesses, whether you?re speaking or writing reports. You?ll often hear it paired with words like data, trends, or figures, as in extrapolate from the data or extrapolate these trends. If extrapolate feels too formal, you could say predict based on this or estimate future performance, but remember, extrapolate has that precise, analytical tone that?s perfect for professional settings.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: infer. Infer is a word we use when we understand something that isn?t directly stated. In product management, we often need to infer meaning from feedback, data, or even silence in meetings. For example, if a stakeholder says they?re concerned about timelines but don?t specify why, you might infer they want more frequent updates. Or when reviewing user feedback, you might infer a feature isn?t intuitive if multiple people struggle with it. Common collocations include infer from, infer that, and can we infer. You?ll use infer both spoken and written, like in emails saying based on the data, we can infer user preferences, or in meetings asking what can we infer from these metrics. Alternatives include deduce, which sounds more formal, or gather, which is more casual. Remember, infer is about reading between the lines, not just hearing what?s said. Thanks for listening.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: predict. Predict is a word you?ll use often in product management when talking about future outcomes or trends. Imagine you?re in a stakeholder meeting discussing your product roadmap. You might say, based on current data, we predict a 20% increase in user engagement next quarter. Or in a written report, you could write, market research helps us predict customer behaviour more accurately. Notice how predict often pairs with words like data, trends, behaviour, or outcomes ? these are common collocations. You can use predict both in spoken and written contexts, whether you?re presenting to your team or drafting an email. If you want alternatives, consider forecast, which sounds a bit more formal, or anticipate, which implies preparing for something expected. Estimate works too, but it?s more about rough calculations than future trends. Remember, predict is your go-to when you?re making informed guesses about what?s coming next. Thanks for listening.

Now, forecast is a word you?ll hear often in product management, especially when planning ahead or discussing future trends. Think of it as predicting what?s coming, whether it?s sales numbers, project timelines, or market demand. For example, in a stakeholder meeting, you might say, based on current data, we forecast a 20% increase in user engagement next quarter. Or when reviewing your product roadmap, you could explain, the team has forecasted a delay in the launch due to supply chain issues. Notice how forecast often pairs with words like sales, demand, revenue, or growth?these are common collocations. You?ll use forecast both in spoken and written contexts, from casual chats to formal reports. If you want alternatives, consider predict, which is more general, or project, which feels a bit more numerical.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: anticipate. Anticipate is a word you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially in product management. It means to expect something and prepare for it before it happens. Think about product roadmaps?you anticipate customer needs to plan features. In stakeholder meetings, you might anticipate questions and prepare answers in advance. For example, you could say, we anticipate high demand for this feature, so let?s allocate more resources. Or, I anticipate some pushback from the marketing team, so I?ve prepared data to support our plan. Common collocations include anticipate challenges, anticipate changes, or anticipate growth. You can use anticipate in both spoken and written contexts?it works equally well in emails, reports, or meetings. If you want alternatives, consider expect, which is more general, or foresee, which sounds slightly more formal. Another option is predict, but that?s better for data-driven forecasts. Remember, anticipate is about expecting and preparing, not just guessing. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: project something. Now, when we say project something in the workplace, especially in product management, we mean estimating or predicting future numbers, trends, or outcomes based on current data.

For example, imagine you?re in a quarterly planning meeting and you need to project next year?s user growth based on this year?s metrics. You might say, we project a 20% increase in active users if we launch these features. Or in a written report, you could write, based on current trends, we project higher demand in Q3. Common collocations include project growth, project costs, or project sales. You?ll use this word both in spoken and written contexts, especially when presenting data or making forecasts. If you want alternatives, consider estimate, which is more general, or forecast, which often implies more detailed analysis.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: offset. Offset is a handy word in product management, especially when you need to balance things out or compensate for something. Imagine you?re presenting a product roadmap and there?s a delay in one feature. You might say, we can offset the delay by launching another feature earlier to keep stakeholders happy. Or perhaps in a budget meeting, you discuss how higher costs in one area can be offset by savings in another. Notice how offset is often used with words like costs, delays, or risks?common collocations you?ll hear in planning discussions. You can use offset both in spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations, whenever you?re talking about balancing trade-offs. If offset feels too formal, you could say balance out or make up for, but these are a bit more casual. Balance out works well in team chats, while make up for fits when explaining solutions to problems. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: outset. The word outset means the very beginning of something, the point where things start, and it?s perfect for talking about projects, plans, or processes in the workplace.

Or in a stakeholder meeting, you could explain, At the outset of the project, we identified key risks, to highlight early decisions. Outset often pairs with phrases like from the outset or at the outset, and it works equally well in spoken and written English, whether you?re in emails, presentations, or casual chats. If you want alternatives, consider using initially or from the start, but note that initially feels a bit more formal, while from the start is more casual.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: increase in something. Now, if you're a product manager, you'll often talk about growth or changes, and increase in something is a handy way to describe that. It means a rise or growth in a particular area, like user engagement, sales, or even team productivity. Imagine you're in a stakeholder meeting discussing your product roadmap. You might say, we?ve seen an increase in user engagement since the latest update, or there?s been an increase in demand for this feature. These phrases sound natural and professional in both spoken and written contexts, whether you?re in emails, reports, or casual chats. Common collocations include increase in sales, increase in efficiency, or increase in costs. If you want alternatives, consider rise in something, which is slightly more formal, or growth in something, which feels more positive and strategic.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: diminish. Diminish means to make something smaller or weaker, or to become smaller or weaker over time. In product management, we often talk about how certain factors can diminish the value of a feature or how delays can diminish stakeholder confidence. For example, if you keep changing the product roadmap without clear communication, you might diminish trust with your team. Or if a competitor launches a similar feature, it could diminish the impact of your own release. Common collocations include diminish returns, diminish enthusiasm, or diminish over time. You can use diminish in both spoken and written contexts, like in meetings when discussing risks or in reports when analysing trends. If you need alternatives, consider reduce, which is more neutral, or undermine, which has a stronger negative tone, like when trust is undermined. Remember, diminish is about gradual weakening, not sudden loss. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: window has shifted. This phrase is super handy in UK workplaces, especially when talking about timelines or deadlines that have changed. Imagine you?re in a product roadmap meeting and the launch date for a feature has moved. Instead of saying the deadline changed, you might say the window has shifted. It sounds more polished and professional. For example, if a stakeholder asks about the project timeline, you could say, just to let you know, the window has shifted by two weeks due to supplier delays. Or in an email update, you might write, following the team discussion, the delivery window has shifted to early November. Common collocations include delivery window has shifted, project window has shifted, or timeline window has shifted. You can use this phrase both in spoken and written communication?it works equally well in meetings, emails, or reports. If you need alternatives, consider the timeline has moved, which is a bit more direct, or the deadline has been adjusted, which sounds slightly more formal. Remember, window has shifted is a natural way to communicate changes without sounding too abrupt. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: incumbent. Now, incumbent is a word you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially when talking about responsibilities or current holders of roles. Think of it as describing who or what is currently in place, whether it?s a person, a system, or even a technology. For example, in product roadmaps, you might discuss the incumbent supplier, meaning the one you?re currently using, or the incumbent process, the way things are done now. In stakeholder meetings, you could say, the incumbent product manager is leading the project until the new hire starts. Notice how incumbent highlights what?s current or existing. It works well in both spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations. Common collocations include incumbent provider, incumbent team, or incumbent system. If you need alternatives, consider current or existing, but remember incumbent sounds more formal and precise, while in-house or sitting can work too, though they?re less common.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: ride the tide. Now, if you?ve ever heard someone say ride the tide in a meeting or read it in an email, you might have wondered what it means. Simply put, to ride the tide is to go along with a situation or trend, especially when it?s changing or uncertain, rather than trying to fight it. It?s about adapting and making the most of the circumstances. For example, imagine your product roadmap suddenly shifts because of new market trends. Instead of resisting, you might say, let?s ride the tide and adjust our priorities to match what customers want now. Or in a stakeholder meeting, if someone suggests aligning with a new industry trend, you could say, I think we should ride the tide on this one and explore how it benefits our strategy. Common collocations include ride the tide of change, ride the tide of demand, or ride the tide of innovation. This phrase works well in both spoken and written contexts, whether you?re chatting in a team huddle or drafting a project update. If you?re looking for alternatives, you might say go with the flow for a more casual tone, or adapt to the trend for something more formal. Remember, riding the tide isn?t about giving up control?it?s about smart flexibility. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

Now, if you?re wondering what stay at the art means, think of it as staying focused on the core creative or innovative aspects of your work, especially when distractions or routine tasks try to pull you away. In product management, you might use this phrase when discussing how to keep your team?s energy on groundbreaking features rather than getting bogged down by administrative details. For example, in a product roadmap meeting, you could say, Let?s stay at the art and prioritise the user experience innovations over minor bug fixes right now. Or in a stakeholder update, you might emphasise, Our goal this quarter is to stay at the art, so we?re dedicating most resources to the new AI integration. Common collocations include stay at the art of innovation, stay at the art of design, or stay at the art of problem-solving. This phrase works well in both spoken and written contexts, especially in brainstorming sessions, strategy emails, or team briefings. If you?re looking for alternatives, you could say keep the creative focus, which is a bit more general, or stick to the visionary work, which has a slightly more aspirational tone.

Now, if you're a product manager, you?ve probably heard this term in meetings or seen it in reports. Monthly Run Rate is a way to estimate future performance based on current data. Imagine you?re discussing your product?s revenue or user growth in a stakeholder meeting. You might say, based on last month?s numbers, our Monthly Run Rate suggests we?ll hit 120,000 users by year-end. It?s a handy phrase for projecting trends, especially when planning budgets or roadmaps. Let?s look at how you?d use it naturally. In a written update, you could write: The current Monthly Run Rate for sales is ?50,000, so we?re on track to meet targets. Or in a spoken context, during a team huddle: Based on our Monthly Run Rate, we need to adjust the timeline for the next feature rollout. Common collocations include tracking Monthly Run Rate, calculating Monthly Run Rate, or projecting based on Monthly Run Rate. You?ll hear it in both spoken and written contexts, from Slack messages to boardroom discussions.

Or perhaps you?re updating your product roadmap and note, The new features drove decent growth in premium subscriptions. It?s a versatile phrase, fitting both spoken updates and written reports. Common collocations include decent growth in revenue, decent growth metrics, or achieving decent growth. If you want alternatives, consider steady growth, which sounds a bit more consistent, or moderate growth, which feels slightly more cautious.

Now, if you're a product manager, you?ll hear this word a lot when talking about testing new ideas or features before a full launch. To pilot something means to run a small-scale trial to see how it works in practice, gather feedback, and make improvements. Imagine you?re in a stakeholder meeting discussing your product roadmap, and you say, Let?s pilot this feature with a select group of users before rolling it out to everyone. That?s a classic example. Or perhaps you?re writing an email to your team and you note, We?re piloting a new process to streamline workflows, so please share your thoughts. Common collocations you?ll hear include pilot project, pilot phase, or pilot group. You can use to pilot in both spoken and written contexts?it?s versatile. If you need alternatives, consider to test, which is more general, or to trial, which is similar but often used in UK contexts, or to run a beta, which is more tech-specific.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: worthwhile. Now, worthwhile is one of those words that sounds formal but actually fits perfectly into everyday work conversations. It simply means something is valuable or useful enough to justify the time or effort you put into it. Think about product roadmaps?you might say adding that new feature is worthwhile if customer feedback shows high demand. Or in stakeholder meetings, you could argue that spending extra time on user testing is worthwhile because it reduces risks later. Notice how worthwhile often pairs with words like effort, investment, or time?common collocations that make your point sound natural. For example, you might say, Let?s discuss whether this project is worthwhile given our current priorities, or, The training was challenging but absolutely worthwhile for my development. You can use worthwhile both in spoken and written contexts?it works equally well in emails or presentations. If you want alternatives, consider valuable or rewarding, but note that valuable is more general, while rewarding often implies personal satisfaction. And remember, worthwhile is about balancing effort and benefit, so use it when you want to highlight that balance. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: fragmented workflows. Now, if you?ve ever felt like your team?s processes are all over the place, with tasks scattered and communication breaking down, you?re probably dealing with fragmented workflows. It?s when work isn?t connected smoothly, like when different departments use separate tools or when product roadmaps don?t align with development sprints. Picture this: your marketing team plans a campaign, but sales hasn?t been looped in, and customer support is using outdated info. That?s a classic example of fragmented workflows causing chaos. Or imagine stakeholder meetings where everyone has different priorities, and no one?s on the same page?again, fragmented workflows at play. You?ll often hear this phrase in both spoken and written contexts, like in reports saying we need to streamline fragmented workflows or in meetings where someone points out how fragmented workflows are slowing us down. Common collocations include addressing fragmented workflows, reducing fragmented workflows, or even fixing fragmented workflows. If you want alternatives, you could say disjointed processes, which has a similar meaning but feels a bit more technical, or siloed operations, which emphasises teams working in isolation.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: awaiting something. When you?re awaiting something, you?re expecting it, you?re waiting for it to arrive or happen, often with a sense of anticipation. In product management, you might be awaiting feedback on a proposal, awaiting approval for a new feature, or awaiting the final numbers from analytics before making a decision. For example, if you?re leading a project, you could say, we?re currently awaiting sign-off from the legal team before we proceed, which means you?re waiting for their approval and can?t move forward without it. Or in a stakeholder update, you might mention, the team is awaiting the results of the user testing to refine the roadmap. Common collocations include awaiting confirmation, awaiting response, and awaiting further instructions. You?ll hear and use awaiting in both spoken and written contexts?emails, meetings, even quick Slack messages. It?s slightly more formal than just saying waiting for, so it fits well in professional settings. If you want alternatives, consider expecting, which feels more neutral, or holding out for, which can sound a bit more informal or even impatient depending on the tone. Thanks for listening.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: respective. Now, respective is one of those words that sounds formal but is actually super handy in everyday work chats. It basically means relating to each person or thing mentioned, in the order they were mentioned. Picture this: you?re in a stakeholder meeting discussing product roadmaps, and you say, the design and engineering teams will review their respective tasks. That means the design team looks at their tasks, and engineering looks at theirs. Simple, right? Another example: after a sprint planning session, you might say, the product owners updated their respective backlogs. Notice how respective keeps things clear without repeating yourself. It works well in both spoken and written contexts, like emails or reports. Common collocations include respective teams, respective roles, respective deadlines. If you want alternatives, you could say individual or specific, but be careful?individual can sound more separate, and specific more detailed. So next time you?re talking about teams or tasks, try slipping in respective to sound polished and precise. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: As of sometime. This phrase is incredibly useful in the workplace when you need to specify a point in time, especially when things change or get updated. Think of product roadmaps, stakeholder meetings, or even email updates where you need to clarify the latest status. For example, you might say, As of Monday, the launch date has moved to the end of the month, or As of our last meeting, the budget has been approved. It?s a clear way to mark when something became true or changed. You?ll often hear it collocated with dates, like As of today, or events, like As of the last update. It works equally well in spoken and written contexts, whether you?re in a quick stand-up or drafting a project report. If you want alternatives, you could say From Monday onwards for a forward-looking tone, or Since last week to emphasise continuity. Just remember, As of sometime is your go-to for pinpointing exact moments in time. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: loading. Now, loading is a word you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially when talking about timelines, systems, or workloads. Imagine you?re in a product roadmap meeting and someone says, we?re still loading the new features into the sprint. That means they?re adding or assigning those features to the development cycle. Or perhaps in a stakeholder update, you might say, the team is currently loading the data into the platform, which means they?re inputting or transferring it. Loading is versatile?it works for both physical tasks like uploading files and abstract ones like loading responsibilities onto a team. You?ll often hear it paired with words like workload, capacity, or system?phrases like loading the backlog or loading the schedule are common. It?s used in both spoken and written contexts, so feel free to drop it into emails or meetings. If loading doesn?t feel quite right, try alternatives like assigning tasks or uploading data, but remember loading has that nice, neutral tone that fits most professional situations.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: year-over-year. Now, if you?re a product manager, you?ll hear this term a lot when discussing growth, performance, or trends. Year-over-year, often shortened to YoY, simply means comparing data from one year to the same period in the previous year. It?s a way to measure progress or decline without seasonal distractions. Imagine you?re in a stakeholder meeting reviewing your product?s performance. You might say, our user engagement grew 15% year-over-year, showing steady progress since last year. Or perhaps you?re presenting a roadmap and highlight, revenue dipped 5% year-over-year, so we?re prioritising retention features. Notice how year-over-year often pairs with growth, decline, increase, or decrease?these are common collocations. You?ll use it both spoken and written, in reports, emails, or presentations. If you want alternatives, consider saying compared to last year for a more conversational tone, or annually for a broader timeframe. Just remember, year-over-year is precise and widely understood in business contexts. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: be capped. When we say something is capped in the UK workplace, it means there?s a limit set on it, a maximum it cannot go beyond. Think of product roadmaps where features might be capped due to budget constraints, or stakeholder meetings where discussion time is capped to keep things efficient. For example, you might hear, our team?s budget is capped at fifty thousand this quarter, so we need to prioritise carefully. Or in a sprint planning meeting, someone could say, the number of story points is capped at thirty to avoid overloading the team. Common collocations include budget is capped, time is capped, or resources are capped. You?ll hear this in both spoken and written contexts, from casual chats to formal emails. If you need alternatives, consider has a limit or is limited, which are more neutral, or has a ceiling, which feels slightly more formal. Remember, be capped is that handy phrase when you need to communicate boundaries clearly. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: paradigm. Now, paradigm is one of those words that sounds quite formal but actually pops up often in UK workplaces, especially when discussing big shifts or new ways of thinking. Imagine you?re in a product roadmap meeting and someone says, The shift to AI-first tools represents a complete paradigm shift for our industry. Here, paradigm means a fundamental change in approach or underlying model. It?s not just a small tweak?it?s a whole new way of doing things. You might also hear it in stakeholder meetings, like when a colleague explains, We need to challenge the current paradigm if we want to innovate. Common collocations include paradigm shift, dominant paradigm, or existing paradigm, and it works equally well in spoken and written contexts. If paradigm feels too heavy, try alternatives like mindset for a softer tone, or framework when talking about structures rather than big changes. Remember, paradigm is about those game-changing ideas, so use it when the conversation calls for something bold. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: legend. Now, legend is a word you might hear a lot in the UK workplace, and it?s a really positive, informal way to describe someone who?s done something amazing or gone above and beyond. Imagine you?re in a product roadmap meeting, and a colleague solves a tricky problem that?s been blocking progress for weeks. You might say, *absolute legend* to show how impressed you are. Or picture this: after a tough stakeholder meeting where someone handles difficult questions perfectly, you could turn to a teammate and say, *she?s a total legend for keeping her cool like that*. It?s a word you?ll mostly hear spoken, not written, and it often pairs with words like absolute, total, or complete to add extra emphasis. If you?re looking for alternatives, you could say *hero* for a similar vibe, or *star* for something a bit lighter, or *rockstar* if you want to sound a bit more playful. Just remember, legend is warm and friendly, so save it for those moments when someone really deserves the praise. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: disclaimer. Now, a disclaimer is a statement that limits responsibility or clarifies the scope of something, and you?ll hear it often in UK workplaces, especially when discussing product roadmaps or presenting to stakeholders. For example, if you?re sharing a product update but the timeline might shift, you might say, just a quick disclaimer, these dates are tentative and could change based on development progress. Or in a written report, you could include a disclaimer like, this analysis is based on preliminary data and should not be taken as final. Notice how disclaimers often pair with words like just a quick disclaimer, important disclaimer, or standard disclaimer, and they?re used both in speaking and writing to manage expectations. If you want alternatives, you could say note that or bear in mind, but these are less formal and better for casual reminders. Another option is for clarity, which works well in emails or meetings when you?re setting the record straight. So remember, disclaimers are your friend when you need to clarify limits or uncertainties?just a quick disclaimer, practice using them and they?ll soon feel natural. Thanks for listening.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: commonalities. Now, commonalities are those shared features or similarities between things, and in the workplace, spotting commonalities helps you connect ideas, people, or products more effectively. Imagine you?re in a stakeholder meeting discussing two product roadmaps. You might say, let?s look for commonalities between these roadmaps to align our priorities. Or perhaps you?re analysing customer feedback and notice commonalities in their pain points?that?s a signal to focus your next sprint. Common collocations include identify commonalities, find commonalities, or explore commonalities, and you?ll use this word both spoken and written, like in emails or presentations when summarising shared themes. If commonalities feels too formal, try similarities for a neutral tone, or overlapping points when stressing specific connections. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: inhibit. Inhibit means to slow something down or stop it from happening, and in the workplace, we often use it to talk about things that block progress or limit potential. For example, if your product roadmap is delayed, you might say unclear priorities inhibit progress, or if stakeholders keep changing requirements, you could say constant changes inhibit the team?s ability to deliver on time. Notice how inhibit often pairs with words like progress, growth, or ability ? these are common collocations that sound natural in UK business English. You can use inhibit in both spoken and written contexts, like in meetings when discussing blockers or in emails explaining delays. If inhibit feels too formal, you could say hold back or slow down in more casual conversations, or use restrict when talking about rules or policies limiting action.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: disprove. Disprove means to show that something is not true or correct, and it?s a word you?ll often hear in product management when discussing data, assumptions, or stakeholder feedback. Imagine you?re in a roadmap meeting and someone claims a feature will definitely increase user engagement. If your analytics data shows no change, you can say the data disproves that assumption. Or perhaps a stakeholder insists a design flaw is causing customer complaints, but your testing reveals no issues?you?ve disproven their theory. Common collocations include disprove a claim, disprove an idea, or disprove a hypothesis. You can use disprove in both spoken and written contexts, like emails, reports, or discussions. If disprove feels too formal, try alternatives like debunk, which has a similar meaning but feels more conversational, or refute, which is slightly stronger and often used in debates. Another option is challenge, which is softer and works well when you?re questioning an idea without outright rejecting it. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

Or in a meeting, you could say, Feel free to come along to the workshop if you?re interested, inviting someone to join. It?s a friendly, natural way to talk about progress or participation. You?ll hear come along in spoken English more than written, but it works in both. Common collocations include coming along well, coming along slowly, or why don?t you come along.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: shared understanding. In the UK workplace, shared understanding means everyone in the team or meeting is on the same page, thinking the same way about a goal or idea. It?s especially important for product managers when discussing product roadmaps or aligning stakeholders. For example, if your team has a shared understanding of the roadmap priorities, fewer misunderstandings happen later. Or imagine a stakeholder meeting where everyone leaves with a shared understanding of the project timeline?this saves time and avoids confusion later. You might hear phrases like building a shared understanding or reaching a shared understanding, often used in both spoken and written contexts like emails or presentations. If shared understanding feels too formal, you could say we?re all aligned, which is a bit more casual, or everyone?s on the same page, which is very conversational.

Now, if you?re working in a UK workplace, especially as a product manager, you?ll hear this phrase a lot. Rang from is a natural way to describe a range or variety of things, especially when talking about options, opinions, or features. For example, in a product roadmap meeting, you might say the feedback rang from very positive to quite critical, meaning the feedback included everything between those two extremes. Or in a stakeholder meeting, you could explain that the suggested features rang from simple UI tweaks to complete platform overhauls. Notice how rang from helps you describe a wide spectrum without listing every single item. It?s a handy phrase for both spoken and written communication, whether you?re in emails, presentations, or casual chats. Common collocations include opinions that rang from, options that rang from, or responses that rang from. If you want alternatives, you could say varied from or spanned from, but rang from has a slightly more conversational tone, perfect for meetings or informal updates. So next time you?re describing a range, try using rang from to sound more natural and fluent. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

Now, tend to is a really useful phrase in the UK workplace because it helps you talk about what usually happens or what people typically do.

Or in meetings, you could mention that engineers tend to ask detailed technical questions, which is their usual way of engaging. Notice how tend to shows a pattern or habit, not a strict rule. It?s great for both spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations, especially when you?re generalising or setting expectations. Common collocations include tend to focus, tend to prefer, or tend to avoid. If you want alternatives, you could say usually or often, but tend to sounds more polished and professional.

Notice how represent is often used with words like data, team, or perspective?these are common collocations. You can use represent in both spoken and written contexts, whether you?re drafting an email or leading a discussion.

No, we mean combining or connecting things in a way that makes sense together. Think of product roadmaps or stakeholder meetings where you need to align different ideas or priorities. For example, you might say, we need to marry the customer feedback with our development timeline to create a realistic roadmap. Or in a meeting, you could suggest, let?s marry the sales team?s targets with our product launch plan to ensure everyone?s aligned. Common collocations include marry the data, marry the strategy, or marry the timelines. This phrase works well in both spoken and written contexts, especially when you want to sound collaborative and strategic. If marry something feels too formal, you could say combine the insights, align the priorities, or blend the approaches, depending on how casual or direct you want to be. Thanks for listening.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: exploratory. Exploratory is a word you?ll hear often in product management, especially when discussing early-stage ideas or research. It means something is done to investigate or explore possibilities, not to make final decisions. For example, in product roadmaps, you might say we?re in an exploratory phase to understand customer needs before committing to features. Or in stakeholder meetings, you could mention running exploratory interviews to gather insights before shaping the strategy. Notice how exploratory often pairs with words like phase, research, meetings, or work. It?s used both in spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations, to signal that you?re still gathering information. If you want alternatives, consider preliminary, which is more formal, or investigative, which sounds more structured. Another option is initial research, but that focuses more on the starting point rather than the open-ended nature of exploratory work. Remember, exploratory is your go-to word when you?re not yet making firm plans but digging deeper into possibilities. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: tweak. Now, tweak is a handy little word you?ll hear a lot in UK workplaces, especially when we?re fine-tuning things. Imagine you?re in a product roadmap meeting, and someone says, let?s tweak the timeline, or perhaps in a stakeholder review, they suggest a small tweak to the design. Tweak means to make a slight adjustment, a small change to improve something. It?s not a big overhaul, just a little nudge to get things right. For example, you might say, we need to tweak the pricing model before launch, or the developer tweaked the code to fix that bug. Common collocations include tweak the plan, tweak the settings, or tweak the wording. You can use tweak in both spoken and written contexts?it?s casual but professional. If you want alternatives, consider adjust, which is a bit more formal, or refine, which implies polishing something further. And if it?s really minor, you could say make a small change. Remember, tweak is your go-to for those small but important improvements. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: throw off. Now, throw off is a phrasal verb you?ll hear a lot in UK workplaces, especially when plans don?t go as expected. It means to disrupt or confuse something, to knock it off course. Imagine you?re presenting a product roadmap update, and someone asks a unexpected question about budget?that could throw off your timing, making you rush or skip key points. Or maybe a last-minute change in stakeholder requirements throws off the entire project schedule. You?ll often hear it with words like schedule, timing, plan, or focus?like when colleagues say, the new regulations threw off our launch plan, or the technical issues threw off the team?s focus. It works in both spoken and written contexts, but it?s more casual, so maybe not for formal reports. If you need alternatives, consider disrupt or derail?disrupt is lighter, like a small delay, while derail feels more serious, like a project stopping completely. Thanks for listening.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: be important doing something. Now, this phrase might sound a bit formal at first, but it?s actually a natural way to highlight priorities in UK workplace conversations, especially for product managers. When you say something is important doing, you?re stressing that it?s a key action that needs attention right now. For example, in a product roadmap discussion, you might say it?s important keeping the user experience simple when rolling out new features. Or in a stakeholder meeting, you could mention it?s important aligning the team on deadlines before moving forward. Notice how the phrase often pairs with verbs like keeping, aligning, or focusing?these are common collocations that sound very natural in professional settings. You can use this phrase both spoken and written, like in emails or presentations, to politely but firmly point out priorities. If you want alternatives, you could say it?s crucial to focus on something for a stronger tone, or it?s worth noting something for a softer approach. Just remember, be important doing something is that perfect middle ground?clear, professional, and effective. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: untapped. Untapped is a fantastic word for product managers because it describes potential that hasn?t been used yet, opportunities waiting to be explored. Imagine you?re in a stakeholder meeting discussing your product roadmap. You might say, we?ve identified an untapped market segment that aligns with our new features. Or perhaps you?re reviewing user feedback and notice untapped potential in a feature that customers aren?t fully utilising. The word untapped often collocates with words like potential, market, opportunity, or resource, making it versatile for both spoken and written contexts. In emails, you could write, our data shows untapped growth in the European market. In meetings, you might say, let?s focus on the untapped areas where we can innovate. If untapped feels too formal, you could use unexplored, which has a similar meaning but feels more neutral, or underutilised, which specifically suggests something isn?t being used enough. Remember, untapped is about possibility, about what could be, so use it when you want to highlight hidden opportunities. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: consider doing something. Now, this is a phrase you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially when discussing options or suggesting ideas. It?s a polite yet professional way to propose an action without being too direct. For example, in product roadmap meetings, you might say, we should consider delaying the feature launch to gather more user feedback. Or in stakeholder meetings, you could suggest, let?s consider running a small pilot before committing to the full rollout. Notice how consider doing something softens the suggestion, making it collaborative. It works well in both spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations. Common collocations include consider revising, consider implementing, or consider adjusting. If you want alternatives, you could say think about doing something, which is slightly more informal, or evaluate doing something, which sounds more analytical. Remember, consider doing something is your go-to for balanced, professional suggestions. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: feat. Now, a feat is something impressive, an achievement that stands out because it took skill or effort to accomplish. In product management, we often talk about feats when describing big milestones or challenging deliverables. Imagine your team launches a complex feature ahead of schedule?that?s a feat. Or perhaps you secure buy-in from hesitant stakeholders for a risky project?another feat. The word works well in both spoken and written contexts, like when you?re praising your team in a meeting or writing a project update. Common collocations include no small feat, impressive feat, or remarkable feat. For example, you might say, delivering the MVP in three months was no small feat, especially with limited resources. Or, pulling off that seamless integration with legacy systems was a remarkable feat by the engineering team. If you want alternatives, consider achievement, which is more general, or triumph, which sounds more celebratory. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: dissect. Now, dissect is a word you?ll hear often in UK workplaces, especially when breaking down complex topics. Imagine you?re in a product roadmap meeting, and someone says, let?s dissect the customer feedback to find key trends. That means they want to examine it carefully, piece by piece. Or perhaps in a stakeholder meeting, you might hear, we need to dissect the project risks before moving forward. Here, dissect means analysing something in detail to understand it better. It?s a word that works well in both spoken and written contexts, whether you?re emailing a colleague or presenting in a meeting. Common collocations include dissect the data, dissect the problem, or dissect the results. If dissect feels too formal, you could say break down, which is more casual, or analyse, which is neutral and professional. Another alternative is scrutinise, but that implies a very careful, almost critical examination. So next time you?re faced with a complex topic, try using dissect to show you?re digging deep into the details. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: opt to. Opt to is a phrase we use when we make a choice, especially in professional settings where decisions matter. Imagine you?re in a product roadmap meeting and you need to choose between two features. You might say, we opted to prioritise the user feedback feature over the analytics upgrade because our customers value responsiveness. Or perhaps in a stakeholder meeting, you explain why the team opted to delay the launch for further testing. It?s about making a deliberate choice, often after considering options. You?ll hear opt to in both spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations, often paired with words like decide, choose, or prioritise. For example, we opted to streamline the process or they opted to extend the deadline. If you want alternatives, you could say decide to, which is more general, or choose to, which feels slightly more personal. Go for select to if you?re in a formal context, like a report. Remember, opt to is about that conscious, thoughtful decision-making we do every day at work. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: get way off. Now, if you?ve ever been in a meeting where the discussion starts about product timelines but suddenly everyone?s talking about office snacks, you?ve seen how conversations get way off track. This phrase means to stray far from the original topic or plan, and it?s super common in UK workplaces when meetings lose focus or projects drift from their goals. For example, you might say, We can?t let this planning session get way off topic?we need to finalise the roadmap by noon. Or imagine a stakeholder update where someone says, The budget discussion got way off track when we started debating marketing colours instead. Common collocations include get way off topic, get way off schedule, or get way off budget. You?ll hear this phrase mostly in spoken English, but it can pop up in informal emails or chat messages too. If you want alternatives, try go off on a tangent for a lighter tone, or deviate significantly for more formal contexts. Just remember, when things get way off, it?s your cue to bring the conversation back on track. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: run out any biases. Now, when we talk about running out any biases, we mean carefully checking and removing any unfair preferences or assumptions, especially when making decisions. Imagine you?re reviewing a product roadmap or leading a stakeholder meeting. You might say, let?s run out any biases in our user feedback before finalising the features. Or, in a team discussion, you could suggest, we need to run out any biases in the data to ensure we?re making objective choices. Common collocations include run out any biases in the analysis, run out any biases from the process, or run out any biases before deciding. This phrase works well in both spoken and written contexts, like emails or meetings. If you?re looking for alternatives, consider eliminate biases, which is more formal, or check for biases, which is a bit softer and more conversational. Remember, running out biases is about fairness and clarity in your work. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: phase something in. When you phase something in, you introduce it gradually, step by step, rather than all at once. This is super useful in product management, especially when rolling out new features or changes. Imagine you?re presenting a roadmap to stakeholders ? you might say we?ll phase in the new update over three months to minimise disruption. Or in a team meeting, you could explain that the design changes will be phased in to give users time to adapt. Common collocations include phase in a feature, phase in a system, or phase in a policy. You?ll hear this in both spoken and written contexts, like emails or presentations. If you need alternatives, consider roll out gradually, which has a similar tone, or introduce step by step, which is a bit more descriptive. Remember, phasing something in is all about smooth, controlled progress. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy. Catch you next time!</podcast:transcript>

  <podcast:transcript type="text/plain" language="en">Welcome to Nexus PM with Suzy. Today's word: phase something out. If you work in product management, you?ll often need to talk about discontinuing products or features gradually, and that?s where phase something out comes in. It means to stop using or providing something slowly over time, rather than all at once. Imagine you?re in a stakeholder meeting discussing an old feature that?s no longer needed. You might say, we plan to phase out the legacy reporting tool by the end of the year, rolling the new one in stages. Or perhaps you?re updating the product roadmap and note, due to low demand, we?re phasing out the mobile app in favour of a web-based solution. Common collocations include phase out a product, phase out a service, or phase out support for something. You?ll use this phrase both spoken and written, in meetings, emails, or presentations. If you need alternatives, consider discontinue, which is more formal and immediate, or wind down, which has a softer, more gradual feel. Remember, phase something out is your go-to for a professional yet natural way to describe a gradual transition. Thanks for listening. This is Nexus PM with Suzy.
